187     INFERNO
188     
189     
190     
191     Inferno: Canto I
192     
193     
194     Midway upon the journey of our life
195       I found myself within a forest dark,
196       For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
197     
198     Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
199       What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
200       Which in the very thought renews the fear.
201     
202     So bitter is it, death is little more;
203       But of the good to treat, which there I found,
204       Speak will I of the other things I saw there.
205     
206     I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
207       So full was I of slumber at the moment
208       In which I had abandoned the true way.
209     
210     But after I had reached a mountain's foot,
211       At that point where the valley terminated,
212       Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
213     
214     Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,
215       Vested already with that planet's rays
216       Which leadeth others right by every road.
217     
218     Then was the fear a little quieted
219       That in my heart's lake had endured throughout
220       The night, which I had passed so piteously.
221     
222     And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
223       Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
224       Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
225     
226     So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
227       Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
228       Which never yet a living person left.
229     
230     After my weary body I had rested,
231       The way resumed I on the desert slope,
232       So that the firm foot ever was the lower.
233     
234     And lo! almost where the ascent began,
235       A panther light and swift exceedingly,
236       Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!
237     
238     And never moved she from before my face,
239       Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
240       That many times I to return had turned.
241     
242     The time was the beginning of the morning,
243       And up the sun was mounting with those stars
244       That with him were, what time the Love Divine
245     
246     At first in motion set those beauteous things;
247       So were to me occasion of good hope,
248       The variegated skin of that wild beast,
249     
250     The hour of time, and the delicious season;
251       But not so much, that did not give me fear
252       A lion's aspect which appeared to me.
253     
254     He seemed as if against me he were coming
255       With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
256       So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
257     
258     And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
259       Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
260       And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
261     
262     She brought upon me so much heaviness,
263       With the affright that from her aspect came,
264       That I the hope relinquished of the height.
265     
266     And as he is who willingly acquires,
267       And the time comes that causes him to lose,
268       Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
269     
270     E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,
271       Which, coming on against me by degrees
272       Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.
273     
274     While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
275       Before mine eyes did one present himself,
276       Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.
277     
278     When I beheld him in the desert vast,
279       "Have pity on me," unto him I cried,
280       "Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"
281     
282     He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,
283       And both my parents were of Lombardy,
284       And Mantuans by country both of them.
285     
286     'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,
287       And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,
288       During the time of false and lying gods.
289     
290     A poet was I, and I sang that just
291       Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,
292       After that Ilion the superb was burned.
293     
294     But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?
295       Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,
296       Which is the source and cause of every joy?"
297     
298     "Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain
299       Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"
300       I made response to him with bashful forehead.
301     
302     "O, of the other poets honour and light,
303       Avail me the long study and great love
304       That have impelled me to explore thy volume!
305     
306     Thou art my master, and my author thou,
307       Thou art alone the one from whom I took
308       The beautiful style that has done honour to me.
309     
310     Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;
311       Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,
312       For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."
313     
314     "Thee it behoves to take another road,"
315       Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
316       "If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
317     
318     Because this beast, at which thou criest out,
319       Suffers not any one to pass her way,
320       But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;
321     
322     And has a nature so malign and ruthless,
323       That never doth she glut her greedy will,
324       And after food is hungrier than before.
325     
326     Many the animals with whom she weds,
327       And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound
328       Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.
329     
330     He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
331       But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;
332       'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;
333     
334     Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,
335       On whose account the maid Camilla died,
336       Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;
337     
338     Through every city shall he hunt her down,
339       Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,
340       There from whence envy first did let her loose.
341     
342     Therefore I think and judge it for thy best
343       Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,
344       And lead thee hence through the eternal place,
345     
346     Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
347       Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,
348       Who cry out each one for the second death;
349     
350     And thou shalt see those who contented are
351       Within the fire, because they hope to come,
352       Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;
353     
354     To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,
355       A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;
356       With her at my departure I will leave thee;
357     
358     Because that Emperor, who reigns above,
359       In that I was rebellious to his law,
360       Wills that through me none come into his city.
361     
362     He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;
363       There is his city and his lofty throne;
364       O happy he whom thereto he elects!"
365     
366     And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,
367       By that same God whom thou didst never know,
368       So that I may escape this woe and worse,
369     
370     Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
371       That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
372       And those thou makest so disconsolate."
373     
374     Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.
375     
376     
377     
378     Inferno: Canto II
379     
380     
381     Day was departing, and the embrowned air
382       Released the animals that are on earth
383       From their fatigues; and I the only one
384     
385     Made myself ready to sustain the war,
386       Both of the way and likewise of the woe,
387       Which memory that errs not shall retrace.
388     
389     O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!
390       O memory, that didst write down what I saw,
391       Here thy nobility shall be manifest!
392     
393     And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,
394       Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,
395       Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.
396     
397     Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,
398       While yet corruptible, unto the world
399       Immortal went, and was there bodily.
400     
401     But if the adversary of all evil
402       Was courteous, thinking of the high effect
403       That issue would from him, and who, and what,
404     
405     To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;
406       For he was of great Rome, and of her empire
407       In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;
408     
409     The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,
410       Were stablished as the holy place, wherein
411       Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.
412     
413     Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,
414       Things did he hear, which the occasion were
415       Both of his victory and the papal mantle.
416     
417     Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,
418       To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,
419       Which of salvation's way is the beginning.
420     
421     But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?
422       I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,
423       Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.
424     
425     Therefore, if I resign myself to come,
426       I fear the coming may be ill-advised;
427       Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."
428     
429     And as he is, who unwills what he willed,
430       And by new thoughts doth his intention change,
431       So that from his design he quite withdraws,
432     
433     Such I became, upon that dark hillside,
434       Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,
435       Which was so very prompt in the beginning.
436     
437     "If I have well thy language understood,"
438       Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,
439       "Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,
440     
441     Which many times a man encumbers so,
442       It turns him back from honoured enterprise,
443       As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.
444     
445     That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,
446       I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard
447       At the first moment when I grieved for thee.
448     
449     Among those was I who are in suspense,
450       And a fair, saintly Lady called to me
451       In such wise, I besought her to command me.
452     
453     Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;
454       And she began to say, gentle and low,
455       With voice angelical, in her own language:
456     
457     'O spirit courteous of Mantua,
458       Of whom the fame still in the world endures,
459       And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;
460     
461     A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,
462       Upon the desert slope is so impeded
463       Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,
464     
465     And may, I fear, already be so lost,
466       That I too late have risen to his succour,
467       From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.
468     
469     Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,
470       And with what needful is for his release,
471       Assist him so, that I may be consoled.
472     
473     Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;
474       I come from there, where I would fain return;
475       Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.
476     
477     When I shall be in presence of my Lord,
478       Full often will I praise thee unto him.'
479       Then paused she, and thereafter I began:
480     
481     'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom
482       The human race exceedeth all contained
483       Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,
484     
485     So grateful unto me is thy commandment,
486       To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;
487       No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.
488     
489     But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun
490       The here descending down into this centre,
491       From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'
492     
493     'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,
494       Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,
495       'Why I am not afraid to enter here.
496     
497     Of those things only should one be afraid
498       Which have the power of doing others harm;
499       Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.
500     
501     God in his mercy such created me
502       That misery of yours attains me not,
503       Nor any flame assails me of this burning.
504     
505     A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves
506       At this impediment, to which I send thee,
507       So that stern judgment there above is broken.
508     
509     In her entreaty she besought Lucia,
510       And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need
511       Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."
512     
513     Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,
514       Hastened away, and came unto the place
515       Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.
516     
517     "Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,
518       Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,
519       For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?
520     
521     Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?
522       Dost thou not see the death that combats him
523       Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"
524     
525     Never were persons in the world so swift
526       To work their weal and to escape their woe,
527       As I, after such words as these were uttered,
528     
529     Came hither downward from my blessed seat,
530       Confiding in thy dignified discourse,
531       Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'
532     
533     After she thus had spoken unto me,
534       Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;
535       Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;
536     
537     And unto thee I came, as she desired;
538       I have delivered thee from that wild beast,
539       Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.
540     
541     What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?
542       Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?
543       Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,
544     
545     Seeing that three such Ladies benedight
546       Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,
547       And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"
548     
549     Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,
550       Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,
551       Uplift themselves all open on their stems;
552     
553     Such I became with my exhausted strength,
554       And such good courage to my heart there coursed,
555       That I began, like an intrepid person:
556     
557     "O she compassionate, who succoured me,
558       And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon
559       The words of truth which she addressed to thee!
560     
561     Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed
562       To the adventure, with these words of thine,
563       That to my first intent I have returned.
564     
565     Now go, for one sole will is in us both,
566       Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."
567       Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,
568     
569     I entered on the deep and savage way.
570     
571     
572     
573     Inferno: Canto III
574     
575     
576     "Through me the way is to the city dolent;
577       Through me the way is to eternal dole;
578       Through me the way among the people lost.
579     
580     Justice incited my sublime Creator;
581       Created me divine Omnipotence,
582       The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.
583     
584     Before me there were no created things,
585       Only eterne, and I eternal last.
586       All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"
587     
588     These words in sombre colour I beheld
589       Written upon the summit of a gate;
590       Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"
591     
592     And he to me, as one experienced:
593       "Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,
594       All cowardice must needs be here extinct.
595     
596     We to the place have come, where I have told thee
597       Thou shalt behold the people dolorous
598       Who have foregone the good of intellect."
599     
600     And after he had laid his hand on mine
601       With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,
602       He led me in among the secret things.
603     
604     There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud
605       Resounded through the air without a star,
606       Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.
607     
608     Languages diverse, horrible dialects,
609       Accents of anger, words of agony,
610       And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,
611     
612     Made up a tumult that goes whirling on
613       For ever in that air for ever black,
614       Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.
615     
616     And I, who had my head with horror bound,
617       Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?
618       What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"
619     
620     And he to me: "This miserable mode
621       Maintain the melancholy souls of those
622       Who lived withouten infamy or praise.
623     
624     Commingled are they with that caitiff choir
625       Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,
626       Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.
627     
628     The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;
629       Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,
630       For glory none the damned would have from them."
631     
632     And I: "O Master, what so grievous is
633       To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"
634       He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.
635     
636     These have no longer any hope of death;
637       And this blind life of theirs is so debased,
638       They envious are of every other fate.
639     
640     No fame of them the world permits to be;
641       Misericord and Justice both disdain them.
642       Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."
643     
644     And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,
645       Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,
646       That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;
647     
648     And after it there came so long a train
649       Of people, that I ne'er would have believed
650       That ever Death so many had undone.
651     
652     When some among them I had recognised,
653       I looked, and I beheld the shade of him
654       Who made through cowardice the great refusal.
655     
656     Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,
657       That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches
658       Hateful to God and to his enemies.
659     
660     These miscreants, who never were alive,
661       Were naked, and were stung exceedingly
662       By gadflies and by hornets that were there.
663     
664     These did their faces irrigate with blood,
665       Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet
666       By the disgusting worms was gathered up.
667     
668     And when to gazing farther I betook me.
669       People I saw on a great river's bank;
670       Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,
671     
672     That I may know who these are, and what law
673       Makes them appear so ready to pass over,
674       As I discern athwart the dusky light."
675     
676     And he to me: "These things shall all be known
677       To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay
678       Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."
679     
680     Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,
681       Fearing my words might irksome be to him,
682       From speech refrained I till we reached the river.
683     
684     And lo! towards us coming in a boat
685       An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,
686       Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!
687     
688     Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;
689       I come to lead you to the other shore,
690       To the eternal shades in heat and frost.
691     
692     And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,
693       Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"
694       But when he saw that I did not withdraw,
695     
696     He said: "By other ways, by other ports
697       Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;
698       A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."
699     
700     And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;
701       It is so willed there where is power to do
702       That which is willed; and farther question not."
703     
704     Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks
705       Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,
706       Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.
707     
708     But all those souls who weary were and naked
709       Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,
710       As soon as they had heard those cruel words.
711     
712     God they blasphemed and their progenitors,
713       The human race, the place, the time, the seed
714       Of their engendering and of their birth!
715     
716     Thereafter all together they drew back,
717       Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,
718       Which waiteth every man who fears not God.
719     
720     Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,
721       Beckoning to them, collects them all together,
722       Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.
723     
724     As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,
725       First one and then another, till the branch
726       Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;
727     
728     In similar wise the evil seed of Adam
729       Throw themselves from that margin one by one,
730       At signals, as a bird unto its lure.
731     
732     So they depart across the dusky wave,
733       And ere upon the other side they land,
734       Again on this side a new troop assembles.
735     
736     "My son," the courteous Master said to me,
737       "All those who perish in the wrath of God
738       Here meet together out of every land;
739     
740     And ready are they to pass o'er the river,
741       Because celestial Justice spurs them on,
742       So that their fear is turned into desire.
743     
744     This way there never passes a good soul;
745       And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,
746       Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."
747     
748     This being finished, all the dusk champaign
749       Trembled so violently, that of that terror
750       The recollection bathes me still with sweat.
751     
752     The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,
753       And fulminated a vermilion light,
754       Which overmastered in me every sense,
755     
756     And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.
757     
758     
759     
760     Inferno: Canto IV
761     
762     
763     Broke the deep lethargy within my head
764       A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,
765       Like to a person who by force is wakened;
766     
767     And round about I moved my rested eyes,
768       Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,
769       To recognise the place wherein I was.
770     
771     True is it, that upon the verge I found me
772       Of the abysmal valley dolorous,
773       That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.
774     
775     Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,
776       So that by fixing on its depths my sight
777       Nothing whatever I discerned therein.
778     
779     "Let us descend now into the blind world,"
780       Began the Poet, pallid utterly;
781       "I will be first, and thou shalt second be."
782     
783     And I, who of his colour was aware,
784       Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,
785       Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"
786     
787     And he to me: "The anguish of the people
788       Who are below here in my face depicts
789       That pity which for terror thou hast taken.
790     
791     Let us go on, for the long way impels us."
792       Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter
793       The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.
794     
795     There, as it seemed to me from listening,
796       Were lamentations none, but only sighs,
797       That tremble made the everlasting air.
798     
799     And this arose from sorrow without torment,
800       Which the crowds had, that many were and great,
801       Of infants and of women and of men.
802     
803     To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask
804       What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?
805       Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,
806     
807     That they sinned not; and if they merit had,
808       'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism
809       Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;
810     
811     And if they were before Christianity,
812       In the right manner they adored not God;
813       And among such as these am I myself.
814     
815     For such defects, and not for other guilt,
816       Lost are we and are only so far punished,
817       That without hope we live on in desire."
818     
819     Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,
820       Because some people of much worthiness
821       I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.
822     
823     "Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"
824       Began I, with desire of being certain
825       Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,
826     
827     "Came any one by his own merit hence,
828       Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"
829       And he, who understood my covert speech,
830     
831     Replied: "I was a novice in this state,
832       When I saw hither come a Mighty One,
833       With sign of victory incoronate.
834     
835     Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,
836       And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,
837       Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient
838     
839     Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,
840       Israel with his father and his children,
841       And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,
842     
843     And others many, and he made them blessed;
844       And thou must know, that earlier than these
845       Never were any human spirits saved."
846     
847     We ceased not to advance because he spake,
848       But still were passing onward through the forest,
849       The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.
850     
851     Not very far as yet our way had gone
852       This side the summit, when I saw a fire
853       That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.
854     
855     We were a little distant from it still,
856       But not so far that I in part discerned not
857       That honourable people held that place.
858     
859     "O thou who honourest every art and science,
860       Who may these be, which such great honour have,
861       That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"
862     
863     And he to me: "The honourable name,
864       That sounds of them above there in thy life,
865       Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."
866     
867     In the mean time a voice was heard by me:
868       "All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;
869       His shade returns again, that was departed."
870     
871     After the voice had ceased and quiet was,
872       Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;
873       Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.
874     
875     To say to me began my gracious Master:
876       "Him with that falchion in his hand behold,
877       Who comes before the three, even as their lord.
878     
879     That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;
880       He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;
881       The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.
882     
883     Because to each of these with me applies
884       The name that solitary voice proclaimed,
885       They do me honour, and in that do well."
886     
887     Thus I beheld assemble the fair school
888       Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,
889       Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.
890     
891     When they together had discoursed somewhat,
892       They turned to me with signs of salutation,
893       And on beholding this, my Master smiled;
894     
895     And more of honour still, much more, they did me,
896       In that they made me one of their own band;
897       So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.
898     
899     Thus we went on as far as to the light,
900       Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,
901       As was the saying of them where I was.
902     
903     We came unto a noble castle's foot,
904       Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,
905       Defended round by a fair rivulet;
906     
907     This we passed over even as firm ground;
908       Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;
909       We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.
910     
911     People were there with solemn eyes and slow,
912       Of great authority in their countenance;
913       They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.
914     
915     Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side
916       Into an opening luminous and lofty,
917       So that they all of them were visible.
918     
919     There opposite, upon the green enamel,
920       Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,
921       Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.
922     
923     I saw Electra with companions many,
924       'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,
925       Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;
926     
927     I saw Camilla and Penthesilea
928       On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,
929       Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;
930     
931     I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,
932       Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,
933       And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.
934     
935     When I had lifted up my brows a little,
936       The Master I beheld of those who know,
937       Sit with his philosophic family.
938     
939     All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.
940       There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,
941       Who nearer him before the others stand;
942     
943     Democritus, who puts the world on chance,
944       Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,
945       Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;
946     
947     Of qualities I saw the good collector,
948       Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,
949       Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,
950     
951     Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,
952       Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,
953       Averroes, who the great Comment made.
954     
955     I cannot all of them pourtray in full,
956       Because so drives me onward the long theme,
957       That many times the word comes short of fact.
958     
959     The sixfold company in two divides;
960       Another way my sapient Guide conducts me
961       Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;
962     
963     And to a place I come where nothing shines.
964     
965     
966     
967     Inferno: Canto V
968     
969     
970     Thus I descended out of the first circle
971       Down to the second, that less space begirds,
972       And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.
973     
974     There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;
975       Examines the transgressions at the entrance;
976       Judges, and sends according as he girds him.
977     
978     I say, that when the spirit evil-born
979       Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;
980       And this discriminator of transgressions
981     
982     Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;
983       Girds himself with his tail as many times
984       As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.
985     
986     Always before him many of them stand;
987       They go by turns each one unto the judgment;
988       They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.
989     
990     "O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry
991       Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,
992       Leaving the practice of so great an office,
993     
994     "Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;
995       Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."
996       And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?
997     
998     Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;
999       It is so willed there where is power to do
1000       That which is willed; and ask no further question."
1001     
1002     And now begin the dolesome notes to grow
1003       Audible unto me; now am I come
1004       There where much lamentation strikes upon me.
1005     
1006     I came into a place mute of all light,
1007       Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,
1008       If by opposing winds 't is combated.
1009     
1010     The infernal hurricane that never rests
1011       Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;
1012       Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.
1013     
1014     When they arrive before the precipice,
1015       There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,
1016       There they blaspheme the puissance divine.
1017     
1018     I understood that unto such a torment
1019       The carnal malefactors were condemned,
1020       Who reason subjugate to appetite.
1021     
1022     And as the wings of starlings bear them on
1023       In the cold season in large band and full,
1024       So doth that blast the spirits maledict;
1025     
1026     It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;
1027       No hope doth comfort them for evermore,
1028       Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.
1029     
1030     And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,
1031       Making in air a long line of themselves,
1032       So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,
1033     
1034     Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.
1035       Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those
1036       People, whom the black air so castigates?"
1037     
1038     "The first of those, of whom intelligence
1039       Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,
1040       "The empress was of many languages.
1041     
1042     To sensual vices she was so abandoned,
1043       That lustful she made licit in her law,
1044       To remove the blame to which she had been led.
1045     
1046     She is Semiramis, of whom we read
1047       That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;
1048       She held the land which now the Sultan rules.
1049     
1050     The next is she who killed herself for love,
1051       And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;
1052       Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."
1053     
1054     Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless
1055       Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,
1056       Who at the last hour combated with Love.
1057     
1058     Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand
1059       Shades did he name and point out with his finger,
1060       Whom Love had separated from our life.
1061     
1062     After that I had listened to my Teacher,
1063       Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,
1064       Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.
1065     
1066     And I began: "O Poet, willingly
1067       Speak would I to those two, who go together,
1068       And seem upon the wind to be so light."
1069     
1070     And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be
1071       Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them
1072       By love which leadeth them, and they will come."
1073     
1074     Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,
1075       My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!
1076       Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."
1077     
1078     As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,
1079       With open and steady wings to the sweet nest
1080       Fly through the air by their volition borne,
1081     
1082     So came they from the band where Dido is,
1083       Approaching us athwart the air malign,
1084       So strong was the affectionate appeal.
1085     
1086     "O living creature gracious and benignant,
1087       Who visiting goest through the purple air
1088       Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,
1089     
1090     If were the King of the Universe our friend,
1091       We would pray unto him to give thee peace,
1092       Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.
1093     
1094     Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,
1095       That will we hear, and we will speak to you,
1096       While silent is the wind, as it is now.
1097     
1098     Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,
1099       Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends
1100       To rest in peace with all his retinue.
1101     
1102     Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,
1103       Seized this man for the person beautiful
1104       That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.
1105     
1106     Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,
1107       Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,
1108       That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;
1109     
1110     Love has conducted us unto one death;
1111       Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"
1112       These words were borne along from them to us.
1113     
1114     As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,
1115       I bowed my face, and so long held it down
1116       Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"
1117     
1118     When I made answer, I began: "Alas!
1119       How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,
1120       Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"
1121     
1122     Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,
1123       And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,
1124       Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.
1125     
1126     But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,
1127       By what and in what manner Love conceded,
1128       That you should know your dubious desires?"
1129     
1130     And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow
1131       Than to be mindful of the happy time
1132       In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.
1133     
1134     But, if to recognise the earliest root
1135       Of love in us thou hast so great desire,
1136       I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.
1137     
1138     One day we reading were for our delight
1139       Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.
1140       Alone we were and without any fear.
1141     
1142     Full many a time our eyes together drew
1143       That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;
1144       But one point only was it that o'ercame us.
1145     
1146     When as we read of the much-longed-for smile
1147       Being by such a noble lover kissed,
1148       This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,
1149     
1150     Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.
1151       Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.
1152       That day no farther did we read therein."
1153     
1154     And all the while one spirit uttered this,
1155       The other one did weep so, that, for pity,
1156       I swooned away as if I had been dying,
1157     
1158     And fell, even as a dead body falls.
1159     
1160     
1161     
1162     Inferno: Canto VI
1163     
1164     
1165     At the return of consciousness, that closed
1166       Before the pity of those two relations,
1167       Which utterly with sadness had confused me,
1168     
1169     New torments I behold, and new tormented
1170       Around me, whichsoever way I move,
1171       And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.
1172     
1173     In the third circle am I of the rain
1174       Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;
1175       Its law and quality are never new.
1176     
1177     Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,
1178       Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;
1179       Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.
1180     
1181     Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,
1182       With his three gullets like a dog is barking
1183       Over the people that are there submerged.
1184     
1185     Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,
1186       And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;
1187       He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.
1188     
1189     Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;
1190       One side they make a shelter for the other;
1191       Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.
1192     
1193     When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!
1194        His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;
1195        Not a limb had he that was motionless.
1196     
1197     And my Conductor, with his spans extended,
1198       Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,
1199       He threw it into those rapacious gullets.
1200     
1201     Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,
1202       And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,
1203       For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,
1204     
1205     The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed
1206       Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders
1207       Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.
1208     
1209     We passed across the shadows, which subdues
1210       The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet
1211       Upon their vanity that person seems.
1212     
1213     They all were lying prone upon the earth,
1214       Excepting one, who sat upright as soon
1215       As he beheld us passing on before him.
1216     
1217     "O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"
1218       He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;
1219       Thyself wast made before I was unmade."
1220     
1221     And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast
1222       Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,
1223       So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.
1224     
1225     But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful
1226       A place art put, and in such punishment,
1227       If some are greater, none is so displeasing."
1228     
1229     And he to me: "Thy city, which is full
1230       Of envy so that now the sack runs over,
1231       Held me within it in the life serene.
1232     
1233     You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
1234       For the pernicious sin of gluttony
1235       I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.
1236     
1237     And I, sad soul, am not the only one,
1238       For all these suffer the like penalty
1239       For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.
1240     
1241     I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness
1242       Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;
1243       But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come
1244     
1245     The citizens of the divided city;
1246       If any there be just; and the occasion
1247       Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."
1248     
1249     And he to me: "They, after long contention,
1250       Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party
1251       Will drive the other out with much offence.
1252     
1253     Then afterwards behoves it this one fall
1254       Within three suns, and rise again the other
1255       By force of him who now is on the coast.
1256     
1257     High will it hold its forehead a long while,
1258       Keeping the other under heavy burdens,
1259       Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.
1260     
1261     The just are two, and are not understood there;
1262       Envy and Arrogance and Avarice
1263       Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."
1264     
1265     Here ended he his tearful utterance;
1266       And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,
1267       And make a gift to me of further speech.
1268     
1269     Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,
1270       Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,
1271       And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,
1272     
1273     Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;
1274       For great desire constraineth me to learn
1275       If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."
1276     
1277     And he: "They are among the blacker souls;
1278       A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;
1279       If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.
1280     
1281     But when thou art again in the sweet world,
1282       I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;
1283       No more I tell thee and no more I answer."
1284     
1285     Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,
1286       Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;
1287       He fell therewith prone like the other blind.
1288     
1289     And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more
1290       This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;
1291       When shall approach the hostile Potentate,
1292     
1293     Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,
1294       Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,
1295       Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."
1296     
1297     So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture
1298       Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,
1299       Touching a little on the future life.
1300     
1301     Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,
1302       Will they increase after the mighty sentence,
1303       Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"
1304     
1305     And he to me: "Return unto thy science,
1306       Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,
1307       The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.
1308     
1309     Albeit that this people maledict
1310       To true perfection never can attain,
1311       Hereafter more than now they look to be."
1312     
1313     Round in a circle by that road we went,
1314       Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;
1315       We came unto the point where the descent is;
1316     
1317     There we found Plutus the great enemy.
1318     
1319     
1320     
1321     Inferno: Canto VII
1322     
1323     
1324     "Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"
1325       Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;
1326       And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,
1327     
1328     Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear
1329       Harm thee; for any power that he may have
1330       Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."
1331     
1332     Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,
1333       And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;
1334       Consume within thyself with thine own rage.
1335     
1336     Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;
1337       Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought
1338       Vengeance upon the proud adultery."
1339     
1340     Even as the sails inflated by the wind
1341       Involved together fall when snaps the mast,
1342       So fell the cruel monster to the earth.
1343     
1344     Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,
1345       Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore
1346       Which all the woe of the universe insacks.
1347     
1348     Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many
1349       New toils and sufferings as I beheld?
1350       And why doth our transgression waste us so?
1351     
1352     As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,
1353       That breaks itself on that which it encounters,
1354       So here the folk must dance their roundelay.
1355     
1356     Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,
1357       On one side and the other, with great howls,
1358       Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.
1359     
1360     They clashed together, and then at that point
1361       Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,
1362       Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"
1363     
1364     Thus they returned along the lurid circle
1365       On either hand unto the opposite point,
1366       Shouting their shameful metre evermore.
1367     
1368     Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about
1369       Through his half-circle to another joust;
1370       And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,
1371     
1372     Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me
1373       What people these are, and if all were clerks,
1374       These shaven crowns upon the left of us."
1375     
1376     And he to me: "All of them were asquint
1377       In intellect in the first life, so much
1378       That there with measure they no spending made.
1379     
1380     Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,
1381       Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,
1382       Where sunders them the opposite defect.
1383     
1384     Clerks those were who no hairy covering
1385       Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,
1386       In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."
1387     
1388     And I: "My Master, among such as these
1389       I ought forsooth to recognise some few,
1390       Who were infected with these maladies."
1391     
1392     And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;
1393       The undiscerning life which made them sordid
1394       Now makes them unto all discernment dim.
1395     
1396     Forever shall they come to these two buttings;
1397       These from the sepulchre shall rise again
1398       With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.
1399     
1400     Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world
1401       Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;
1402       Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.
1403     
1404     Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce
1405       Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,
1406       For which the human race each other buffet;
1407     
1408     For all the gold that is beneath the moon,
1409       Or ever has been, of these weary souls
1410       Could never make a single one repose."
1411     
1412     "Master," I said to him, "now tell me also
1413       What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,
1414       That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"
1415     
1416     And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,
1417       What ignorance is this which doth beset you?
1418       Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.
1419     
1420     He whose omniscience everything transcends
1421       The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,
1422       That every part to every part may shine,
1423     
1424     Distributing the light in equal measure;
1425       He in like manner to the mundane splendours
1426       Ordained a general ministress and guide,
1427     
1428     That she might change at times the empty treasures
1429       From race to race, from one blood to another,
1430       Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.
1431     
1432     Therefore one people triumphs, and another
1433       Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,
1434       Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.
1435     
1436     Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;
1437       She makes provision, judges, and pursues
1438       Her governance, as theirs the other gods.
1439     
1440     Her permutations have not any truce;
1441       Necessity makes her precipitate,
1442       So often cometh who his turn obtains.
1443     
1444     And this is she who is so crucified
1445       Even by those who ought to give her praise,
1446       Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.
1447     
1448     But she is blissful, and she hears it not;
1449       Among the other primal creatures gladsome
1450       She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.
1451     
1452     Let us descend now unto greater woe;
1453       Already sinks each star that was ascending
1454       When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."
1455     
1456     We crossed the circle to the other bank,
1457       Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself
1458       Along a gully that runs out of it.
1459     
1460     The water was more sombre far than perse;
1461       And we, in company with the dusky waves,
1462       Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.
1463     
1464     A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,
1465       This tristful brooklet, when it has descended
1466       Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.
1467     
1468     And I, who stood intent upon beholding,
1469       Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,
1470       All of them naked and with angry look.
1471     
1472     They smote each other not alone with hands,
1473       But with the head and with the breast and feet,
1474       Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.
1475     
1476     Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest
1477       The souls of those whom anger overcame;
1478       And likewise I would have thee know for certain
1479     
1480     Beneath the water people are who sigh
1481       And make this water bubble at the surface,
1482       As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.
1483     
1484     Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were
1485       In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,
1486       Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;
1487     
1488     Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'
1489       This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,
1490       For with unbroken words they cannot say it."
1491     
1492     Thus we went circling round the filthy fen
1493       A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,
1494       With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;
1495     
1496     Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.
1497     
1498     
1499     
1500     Inferno: Canto VIII
1501     
1502     
1503     I say, continuing, that long before
1504       We to the foot of that high tower had come,
1505       Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,
1506     
1507     By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,
1508       And from afar another answer them,
1509       So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.
1510     
1511     And, to the sea of all discernment turned,
1512       I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth
1513       That other fire? and who are they that made it?"
1514     
1515     And he to me: "Across the turbid waves
1516       What is expected thou canst now discern,
1517       If reek of the morass conceal it not."
1518     
1519     Cord never shot an arrow from itself
1520       That sped away athwart the air so swift,
1521       As I beheld a very little boat
1522     
1523     Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,
1524       Under the guidance of a single pilot,
1525       Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"
1526     
1527     "Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain
1528       For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us
1529       Longer than in the passing of the slough."
1530     
1531     As he who listens to some great deceit
1532       That has been done to him, and then resents it,
1533       Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.
1534     
1535     My Guide descended down into the boat,
1536       And then he made me enter after him,
1537       And only when I entered seemed it laden.
1538     
1539     Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,
1540       The antique prow goes on its way, dividing
1541       More of the water than 'tis wont with others.
1542     
1543     While we were running through the dead canal,
1544       Uprose in front of me one full of mire,
1545       And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"
1546     
1547     And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;
1548       But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"
1549       "Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.
1550     
1551     And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,
1552       Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;
1553       For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."
1554     
1555     Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;
1556       Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,
1557       Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"
1558     
1559     Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;
1560       He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,
1561       Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.
1562     
1563     That was an arrogant person in the world;
1564       Goodness is none, that decks his memory;
1565       So likewise here his shade is furious.
1566     
1567     How many are esteemed great kings up there,
1568       Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,
1569       Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"
1570     
1571     And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,
1572       If I could see him soused into this broth,
1573       Before we issue forth out of the lake."
1574     
1575     And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore
1576       Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;
1577       Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."
1578     
1579     A little after that, I saw such havoc
1580       Made of him by the people of the mire,
1581       That still I praise and thank my God for it.
1582     
1583     They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"
1584       And that exasperate spirit Florentine
1585       Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.
1586     
1587     We left him there, and more of him I tell not;
1588       But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,
1589       Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.
1590     
1591     And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,
1592       The city draweth near whose name is Dis,
1593       With the grave citizens, with the great throng."
1594     
1595     And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly
1596       Within there in the valley I discern
1597       Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire
1598     
1599     They were."  And he to me: "The fire eternal
1600       That kindles them within makes them look red,
1601       As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."
1602     
1603     Then we arrived within the moats profound,
1604       That circumvallate that disconsolate city;
1605       The walls appeared to me to be of iron.
1606     
1607     Not without making first a circuit wide,
1608       We came unto a place where loud the pilot
1609       Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."
1610     
1611     More than a thousand at the gates I saw
1612       Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily
1613       Were saying, "Who is this that without death
1614     
1615     Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"
1616       And my sagacious Master made a sign
1617       Of wishing secretly to speak with them.
1618     
1619     A little then they quelled their great disdain,
1620       And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone
1621       Who has so boldly entered these dominions.
1622     
1623     Let him return alone by his mad road;
1624       Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,
1625       Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."
1626     
1627     Think, Reader, if I was discomforted
1628       At utterance of the accursed words;
1629       For never to return here I believed.
1630     
1631     "O my dear Guide, who more than seven times
1632       Hast rendered me security, and drawn me
1633       From imminent peril that before me stood,
1634     
1635     Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;
1636       And if the going farther be denied us,
1637       Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."
1638     
1639     And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,
1640       Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage
1641       None can take from us, it by Such is given.
1642     
1643     But here await me, and thy weary spirit
1644       Comfort and nourish with a better hope;
1645       For in this nether world I will not leave thee."
1646     
1647     So onward goes and there abandons me
1648       My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,
1649       For No and Yes within my head contend.
1650     
1651     I could not hear what he proposed to them;
1652       But with them there he did not linger long,
1653       Ere each within in rivalry ran back.
1654     
1655     They closed the portals, those our adversaries,
1656       On my Lord's breast, who had remained without
1657       And turned to me with footsteps far between.
1658     
1659     His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he
1660       Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,
1661       "Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"
1662     
1663     And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,
1664       Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,
1665       Whatever for defence within be planned.
1666     
1667     This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;
1668       For once they used it at less secret gate,
1669       Which finds itself without a fastening still.
1670     
1671     O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;
1672       And now this side of it descends the steep,
1673       Passing across the circles without escort,
1674     
1675     One by whose means the city shall be opened."
1676     
1677     
1678     
1679     Inferno: Canto IX
1680     
1681     
1682     That hue which cowardice brought out on me,
1683       Beholding my Conductor backward turn,
1684       Sooner repressed within him his new colour.
1685     
1686     He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,
1687       Because the eye could not conduct him far
1688       Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.
1689     
1690     "Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"
1691       Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .
1692       O how I long that some one here arrive!"
1693     
1694     Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning
1695       He covered up with what came afterward,
1696       That they were words quite different from the first;
1697     
1698     But none the less his saying gave me fear,
1699       Because I carried out the broken phrase,
1700       Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.
1701     
1702     "Into this bottom of the doleful conch
1703       Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,
1704       Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"
1705     
1706     This question put I; and he answered me:
1707       "Seldom it comes to pass that one of us
1708       Maketh the journey upon which I go.
1709     
1710     True is it, once before I here below
1711       Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,
1712       Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.
1713     
1714     Naked of me short while the flesh had been,
1715       Before within that wall she made me enter,
1716       To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;
1717     
1718     That is the lowest region and the darkest,
1719       And farthest from the heaven which circles all.
1720       Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.
1721     
1722     This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,
1723       Encompasses about the city dolent,
1724       Where now we cannot enter without anger."
1725     
1726     And more he said, but not in mind I have it;
1727       Because mine eye had altogether drawn me
1728       Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,
1729     
1730     Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen
1731       The three infernal Furies stained with blood,
1732       Who had the limbs of women and their mien,
1733     
1734     And with the greenest hydras were begirt;
1735       Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,
1736       Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.
1737     
1738     And he who well the handmaids of the Queen
1739       Of everlasting lamentation knew,
1740       Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.
1741     
1742     This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;
1743       She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;
1744       Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.
1745     
1746     Each one her breast was rending with her nails;
1747       They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,
1748       That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.
1749     
1750     "Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"
1751       All shouted looking down; "in evil hour
1752       Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"
1753     
1754     "Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,
1755       For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,
1756       No more returning upward would there be."
1757     
1758     Thus said the Master; and he turned me round
1759       Himself, and trusted not unto my hands
1760       So far as not to blind me with his own.
1761     
1762     O ye who have undistempered intellects,
1763       Observe the doctrine that conceals itself
1764       Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!
1765     
1766     And now there came across the turbid waves
1767       The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,
1768       Because of which both of the margins trembled;
1769     
1770     Not otherwise it was than of a wind
1771       Impetuous on account of adverse heats,
1772       That smites the forest, and, without restraint,
1773     
1774     The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;
1775       Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,
1776       And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.
1777     
1778     Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve
1779       Of vision now along that ancient foam,
1780       There yonder where that smoke is most intense."
1781     
1782     Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent
1783       Across the water scatter all abroad,
1784       Until each one is huddled in the earth.
1785     
1786     More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,
1787       Thus fleeing from before one who on foot
1788       Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.
1789     
1790     From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,
1791       Waving his left hand oft in front of him,
1792       And only with that anguish seemed he weary.
1793     
1794     Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,
1795       And to the Master turned; and he made sign
1796       That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.
1797     
1798     Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!
1799       He reached the gate, and with a little rod
1800       He opened it, for there was no resistance.
1801     
1802     "O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"
1803       Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;
1804       "Whence is this arrogance within you couched?
1805     
1806     Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,
1807       From which the end can never be cut off,
1808       And which has many times increased your pain?
1809     
1810     What helpeth it to butt against the fates?
1811       Your Cerberus, if you remember well,
1812       For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."
1813     
1814     Then he returned along the miry road,
1815       And spake no word to us, but had the look
1816       Of one whom other care constrains and goads
1817     
1818     Than that of him who in his presence is;
1819       And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,
1820       After those holy words all confident.
1821     
1822     Within we entered without any contest;
1823       And I, who inclination had to see
1824       What the condition such a fortress holds,
1825     
1826     Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,
1827       And see on every hand an ample plain,
1828       Full of distress and torment terrible.
1829     
1830     Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,
1831       Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,
1832       That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,
1833     
1834     The sepulchres make all the place uneven;
1835       So likewise did they there on every side,
1836       Saving that there the manner was more bitter;
1837     
1838     For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,
1839       By which they so intensely heated were,
1840       That iron more so asks not any art.
1841     
1842     All of their coverings uplifted were,
1843       And from them issued forth such dire laments,
1844       Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.
1845     
1846     And I: "My Master, what are all those people
1847       Who, having sepulture within those tombs,
1848       Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"
1849     
1850     And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,
1851       With their disciples of all sects, and much
1852       More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.
1853     
1854     Here like together with its like is buried;
1855       And more and less the monuments are heated."
1856       And when he to the right had turned, we passed
1857     
1858     Between the torments and high parapets.
1859     
1860     
1861     
1862     Inferno: Canto X
1863     
1864     
1865     Now onward goes, along a narrow path
1866       Between the torments and the city wall,
1867       My Master, and I follow at his back.
1868     
1869     "O power supreme, that through these impious circles
1870       Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,
1871       Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;
1872     
1873     The people who are lying in these tombs,
1874       Might they be seen? already are uplifted
1875       The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."
1876     
1877     And he to me: "They all will be closed up
1878       When from Jehoshaphat they shall return
1879       Here with the bodies they have left above.
1880     
1881     Their cemetery have upon this side
1882       With Epicurus all his followers,
1883       Who with the body mortal make the soul;
1884     
1885     But in the question thou dost put to me,
1886       Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,
1887       And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."
1888     
1889     And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed
1890       From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,
1891       Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."
1892     
1893     "O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire
1894       Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,
1895       Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.
1896     
1897     Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest
1898       A native of that noble fatherland,
1899       To which perhaps I too molestful was."
1900     
1901     Upon a sudden issued forth this sound
1902       From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,
1903       Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.
1904     
1905     And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?
1906       Behold there Farinata who has risen;
1907       From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."
1908     
1909     I had already fixed mine eyes on his,
1910       And he uprose erect with breast and front
1911       E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.
1912     
1913     And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader
1914       Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,
1915       Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."
1916     
1917     As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb
1918       Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,
1919       Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"
1920     
1921     I, who desirous of obeying was,
1922       Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;
1923       Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.
1924     
1925     Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been
1926       To me, and to my fathers, and my party;
1927       So that two several times I scattered them."
1928     
1929     "If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"
1930       I answered him, "the first time and the second;
1931       But yours have not acquired that art aright."
1932     
1933     Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered
1934       Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;
1935       I think that he had risen on his knees.
1936     
1937     Round me he gazed, as if solicitude
1938       He had to see if some one else were with me,
1939       But after his suspicion was all spent,
1940     
1941     Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind
1942       Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,
1943       Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"
1944     
1945     And I to him: "I come not of myself;
1946       He who is waiting yonder leads me here,
1947       Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."
1948     
1949     His language and the mode of punishment
1950       Already unto me had read his name;
1951       On that account my answer was so full.
1952     
1953     Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How
1954       Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?
1955       Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"
1956     
1957     When he became aware of some delay,
1958       Which I before my answer made, supine
1959       He fell again, and forth appeared no more.
1960     
1961     But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire
1962       I had remained, did not his aspect change,
1963       Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.
1964     
1965     "And if," continuing his first discourse,
1966       "They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,
1967       That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.
1968     
1969     But fifty times shall not rekindled be
1970       The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,
1971       Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;
1972     
1973     And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,
1974       Say why that people is so pitiless
1975       Against my race in each one of its laws?"
1976     
1977     Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage
1978       Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause
1979       Such orisons in our temple to be made."
1980     
1981     After his head he with a sigh had shaken,
1982       "There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely
1983       Without a cause had with the others moved.
1984     
1985     But there I was alone, where every one
1986       Consented to the laying waste of Florence,
1987       He who defended her with open face."
1988     
1989     "Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"
1990       I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,
1991       Which has entangled my conceptions here.
1992     
1993     It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,
1994       Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,
1995       And in the present have another mode."
1996     
1997     "We see, like those who have imperfect sight,
1998       The things," he said, "that distant are from us;
1999       So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.
2000     
2001     When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain
2002       Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,
2003       Not anything know we of your human state.
2004     
2005     Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead
2006       Will be our knowledge from the moment when
2007       The portal of the future shall be closed."
2008     
2009     Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,
2010       Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,
2011       That still his son is with the living joined.
2012     
2013     And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,
2014       Tell him I did it because I was thinking
2015       Already of the error you have solved me."
2016     
2017     And now my Master was recalling me,
2018       Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit
2019       That he would tell me who was with him there.
2020     
2021     He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;
2022       Within here is the second Frederick,
2023       And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."
2024     
2025     Thereon he hid himself; and I towards
2026       The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting
2027       Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.
2028     
2029     He moved along; and afterward thus going,
2030       He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"
2031       And I in his inquiry satisfied him.
2032     
2033     "Let memory preserve what thou hast heard
2034       Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,
2035       "And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.
2036     
2037     "When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet
2038       Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,
2039       From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."
2040     
2041     Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;
2042       We left the wall, and went towards the middle,
2043       Along a path that strikes into a valley,
2044     
2045     Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.
2046     
2047     
2048     
2049     Inferno: Canto XI
2050     
2051     
2052     Upon the margin of a lofty bank
2053       Which great rocks broken in a circle made,
2054       We came upon a still more cruel throng;
2055     
2056     And there, by reason of the horrible
2057       Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,
2058       We drew ourselves aside behind the cover
2059     
2060     Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,
2061       Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,
2062       Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."
2063     
2064     "Slow it behoveth our descent to be,
2065       So that the sense be first a little used
2066       To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."
2067     
2068     The Master thus; and unto him I said,
2069       "Some compensation find, that the time pass not
2070       Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.
2071     
2072     My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"
2073       Began he then to say, "are three small circles,
2074       From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.
2075     
2076     They all are full of spirits maledict;
2077       But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,
2078       Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.
2079     
2080     Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,
2081       Injury is the end; and all such end
2082       Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.
2083     
2084     But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,
2085       More it displeases God; and so stand lowest
2086       The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.
2087     
2088     All the first circle of the Violent is;
2089       But since force may be used against three persons,
2090       In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.
2091     
2092     To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we
2093       Use force; I say on them and on their things,
2094       As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.
2095     
2096     A death by violence, and painful wounds,
2097       Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance
2098       Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;
2099     
2100     Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,
2101       Marauders, and freebooters, the first round
2102       Tormenteth all in companies diverse.
2103     
2104     Man may lay violent hands upon himself
2105       And his own goods; and therefore in the second
2106       Round must perforce without avail repent
2107     
2108     Whoever of your world deprives himself,
2109       Who games, and dissipates his property,
2110       And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.
2111     
2112     Violence can be done the Deity,
2113       In heart denying and blaspheming Him,
2114       And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.
2115     
2116     And for this reason doth the smallest round
2117       Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,
2118       And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.
2119     
2120     Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,
2121       A man may practise upon him who trusts,
2122       And him who doth no confidence imburse.
2123     
2124     This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers
2125       Only the bond of love which Nature makes;
2126       Wherefore within the second circle nestle
2127     
2128     Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,
2129       Falsification, theft, and simony,
2130       Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.
2131     
2132     By the other mode, forgotten is that love
2133       Which Nature makes, and what is after added,
2134       From which there is a special faith engendered.
2135     
2136     Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is
2137       Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,
2138       Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."
2139     
2140     And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds
2141       Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes
2142       This cavern and the people who possess it.
2143     
2144     But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,
2145       Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,
2146       And who encounter with such bitter tongues,
2147     
2148     Wherefore are they inside of the red city
2149       Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,
2150       And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"
2151     
2152     And unto me he said: "Why wanders so
2153       Thine intellect from that which it is wont?
2154       Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?
2155     
2156     Hast thou no recollection of those words
2157       With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses
2158       The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,--
2159     
2160     Incontinence, and Malice, and insane
2161       Bestiality? and how Incontinence
2162       Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?
2163     
2164     If thou regardest this conclusion well,
2165       And to thy mind recallest who they are
2166       That up outside are undergoing penance,
2167     
2168     Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons
2169       They separated are, and why less wroth
2170       Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."
2171     
2172     "O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,
2173       Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,
2174       That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!
2175     
2176     Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,
2177       "There where thou sayest that usury offends
2178       Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."
2179     
2180     "Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,
2181       Noteth, not only in one place alone,
2182       After what manner Nature takes her course
2183     
2184     From Intellect Divine, and from its art;
2185       And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,
2186       After not many pages shalt thou find,
2187     
2188     That this your art as far as possible
2189       Follows, as the disciple doth the master;
2190       So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.
2191     
2192     From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind
2193       Genesis at the beginning, it behoves
2194       Mankind to gain their life and to advance;
2195     
2196     And since the usurer takes another way,
2197       Nature herself and in her follower
2198       Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.
2199     
2200     But follow, now, as I would fain go on,
2201       For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,
2202       And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,
2203     
2204     And far beyond there we descend the crag."
2205     
2206     
2207     
2208     Inferno: Canto XII
2209     
2210     
2211     The place where to descend the bank we came
2212       Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,
2213       Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.
2214     
2215     Such as that ruin is which in the flank
2216       Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,
2217       Either by earthquake or by failing stay,
2218     
2219     For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,
2220       Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,
2221       Some path 'twould give to him who was above;
2222     
2223     Even such was the descent of that ravine,
2224       And on the border of the broken chasm
2225       The infamy of Crete was stretched along,
2226     
2227     Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;
2228       And when he us beheld, he bit himself,
2229       Even as one whom anger racks within.
2230     
2231     My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure
2232       Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,
2233       Who in the world above brought death to thee?
2234     
2235     Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not
2236       Instructed by thy sister, but he comes
2237       In order to behold your punishments."
2238     
2239     As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment
2240       In which he has received the mortal blow,
2241       Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,
2242     
2243     The Minotaur beheld I do the like;
2244       And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;
2245       While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."
2246     
2247     Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge
2248       Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves
2249       Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.
2250     
2251     Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking
2252       Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded
2253       By that brute anger which just now I quenched.
2254     
2255     Now will I have thee know, the other time
2256       I here descended to the nether Hell,
2257       This precipice had not yet fallen down.
2258     
2259     But truly, if I well discern, a little
2260       Before His coming who the mighty spoil
2261       Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,
2262     
2263     Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley
2264       Trembled so, that I thought the Universe
2265       Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think
2266     
2267     The world ofttimes converted into chaos;
2268       And at that moment this primeval crag
2269       Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.
2270     
2271     But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near
2272       The river of blood, within which boiling is
2273       Whoe'er by violence doth injure others."
2274     
2275     O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,
2276       That spurs us onward so in our short life,
2277       And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!
2278     
2279     I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,
2280       As one which all the plain encompasses,
2281       Conformable to what my Guide had said.
2282     
2283     And between this and the embankment's foot
2284       Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,
2285       As in the world they used the chase to follow.
2286     
2287     Beholding us descend, each one stood still,
2288       And from the squadron three detached themselves,
2289       With bows and arrows in advance selected;
2290     
2291     And from afar one cried: "Unto what torment
2292       Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?
2293       Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow."
2294     
2295     My Master said: "Our answer will we make
2296       To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,
2297       That will of thine was evermore so hasty."
2298     
2299     Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,
2300       Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,
2301       And for himself, himself did vengeance take.
2302     
2303     And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,
2304       Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;
2305       That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.
2306     
2307     Thousands and thousands go about the moat
2308       Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges
2309       Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."
2310     
2311     Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;
2312       Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch
2313       Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.
2314     
2315     After he had uncovered his great mouth,
2316       He said to his companions: "Are you ware
2317       That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?
2318     
2319     Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."
2320       And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,
2321       Where the two natures are together joined,
2322     
2323     Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone
2324       Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;
2325       Necessity, and not delight, impels us.
2326     
2327     Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,
2328       Who unto me committed this new office;
2329       No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.
2330     
2331     But by that virtue through which I am moving
2332       My steps along this savage thoroughfare,
2333       Give us some one of thine, to be with us,
2334     
2335     And who may show us where to pass the ford,
2336       And who may carry this one on his back;
2337       For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."
2338     
2339     Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,
2340       And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,
2341       And warn aside, if other band may meet you."
2342     
2343     We with our faithful escort onward moved
2344       Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,
2345       Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.
2346     
2347     People I saw within up to the eyebrows,
2348       And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,
2349       Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.
2350     
2351     Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here
2352       Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius
2353       Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.
2354     
2355     That forehead there which has the hair so black
2356       Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,
2357       Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,
2358     
2359     Up in the world was by his stepson slain."
2360       Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,
2361       "Now he be first to thee, and second I."
2362     
2363     A little farther on the Centaur stopped
2364       Above a folk, who far down as the throat
2365       Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.
2366     
2367     A shade he showed us on one side alone,
2368       Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom
2369       The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."
2370     
2371     Then people saw I, who from out the river
2372       Lifted their heads and also all the chest;
2373       And many among these I recognised.
2374     
2375     Thus ever more and more grew shallower
2376       That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;
2377       And there across the moat our passage was.
2378     
2379     "Even as thou here upon this side beholdest
2380       The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"
2381       The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe
2382     
2383     That on this other more and more declines
2384       Its bed, until it reunites itself
2385       Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.
2386     
2387     Justice divine, upon this side, is goading
2388       That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,
2389       And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks
2390     
2391     The tears which with the boiling it unseals
2392       In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,
2393       Who made upon the highways so much war."
2394     
2395     Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.
2396     
2397     
2398     
2399     Inferno: Canto XIII
2400     
2401     
2402     Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,
2403       When we had put ourselves within a wood,
2404       That was not marked by any path whatever.
2405     
2406     Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,
2407       Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,
2408       Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.
2409     
2410     Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,
2411       Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold
2412       'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.
2413     
2414     There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,
2415       Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,
2416       With sad announcement of impending doom;
2417     
2418     Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,
2419       And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;
2420       They make laments upon the wondrous trees.
2421     
2422     And the good Master: "Ere thou enter farther,
2423       Know that thou art within the second round,"
2424       Thus he began to say, "and shalt be, till
2425     
2426     Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;
2427       Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see
2428       Things that will credence give unto my speech."
2429     
2430     I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,
2431       And person none beheld I who might make them,
2432       Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.
2433     
2434     I think he thought that I perhaps might think
2435       So many voices issued through those trunks
2436       From people who concealed themselves from us;
2437     
2438     Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off
2439       Some little spray from any of these trees,
2440       The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."
2441     
2442     Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,
2443       And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;
2444       And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"
2445     
2446     After it had become embrowned with blood,
2447       It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?
2448       Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?
2449     
2450     Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;
2451       Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,
2452       Even if the souls of serpents we had been."
2453     
2454     As out of a green brand, that is on fire
2455       At one of the ends, and from the other drips
2456       And hisses with the wind that is escaping;
2457     
2458     So from that splinter issued forth together
2459       Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip
2460       Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.
2461     
2462     "Had he been able sooner to believe,"
2463       My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,
2464       What only in my verses he has seen,
2465     
2466     Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;
2467       Whereas the thing incredible has caused me
2468       To put him to an act which grieveth me.
2469     
2470     But tell him who thou wast, so that by way
2471       Of some amends thy fame he may refresh
2472       Up in the world, to which he can return."
2473     
2474     And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,
2475       I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,
2476       That I a little to discourse am tempted.
2477     
2478     I am the one who both keys had in keeping
2479       Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro
2480       So softly in unlocking and in locking,
2481     
2482     That from his secrets most men I withheld;
2483       Fidelity I bore the glorious office
2484       So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.
2485     
2486     The courtesan who never from the dwelling
2487       Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,
2488       Death universal and the vice of courts,
2489     
2490     Inflamed against me all the other minds,
2491       And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,
2492       That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.
2493     
2494     My spirit, in disdainful exultation,
2495       Thinking by dying to escape disdain,
2496       Made me unjust against myself, the just.
2497     
2498     I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,
2499       Do swear to you that never broke I faith
2500       Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;
2501     
2502     And to the world if one of you return,
2503       Let him my memory comfort, which is lying
2504       Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."
2505     
2506     Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"
2507       The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,
2508       But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."
2509     
2510     Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire
2511       Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;
2512       For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."
2513     
2514     Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man
2515       Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,
2516       Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased
2517     
2518     To tell us in what way the soul is bound
2519       Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,
2520       If any from such members e'er is freed."
2521     
2522     Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward
2523       The wind was into such a voice converted:
2524       "With brevity shall be replied to you.
2525     
2526     When the exasperated soul abandons
2527       The body whence it rent itself away,
2528       Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.
2529     
2530     It falls into the forest, and no part
2531       Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,
2532       There like a grain of spelt it germinates.
2533     
2534     It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;
2535       The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,
2536       Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.
2537     
2538     Like others for our spoils shall we return;
2539       But not that any one may them revest,
2540       For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.
2541     
2542     Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal
2543       Forest our bodies shall suspended be,
2544       Each to the thorn of his molested shade."
2545     
2546     We were attentive still unto the trunk,
2547       Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,
2548       When by a tumult we were overtaken,
2549     
2550     In the same way as he is who perceives
2551       The boar and chase approaching to his stand,
2552       Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;
2553     
2554     And two behold! upon our left-hand side,
2555       Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,
2556       That of the forest, every fan they broke.
2557     
2558     He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"
2559       And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,
2560       Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert
2561     
2562     Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"
2563       And then, perchance because his breath was failing,
2564       He grouped himself together with a bush.
2565     
2566     Behind them was the forest full of black
2567       She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot
2568       As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.
2569     
2570     On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,
2571       And him they lacerated piece by piece,
2572       Thereafter bore away those aching members.
2573     
2574     Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,
2575       And led me to the bush, that all in vain
2576       Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.
2577     
2578     "O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,
2579       What helped it thee of me to make a screen?
2580       What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"
2581     
2582     When near him had the Master stayed his steps,
2583       He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many
2584       Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"
2585     
2586     And he to us: "O souls, that hither come
2587       To look upon the shameful massacre
2588       That has so rent away from me my leaves,
2589     
2590     Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;
2591       I of that city was which to the Baptist
2592       Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this
2593     
2594     Forever with his art will make it sad.
2595       And were it not that on the pass of Arno
2596       Some glimpses of him are remaining still,
2597     
2598     Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it
2599       Upon the ashes left by Attila,
2600       In vain had caused their labour to be done.
2601     
2602     Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."
2603     
2604     
2605     
2606     Inferno: Canto XIV
2607     
2608     
2609     Because the charity of my native place
2610       Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,
2611       And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.
2612     
2613     Then came we to the confine, where disparted
2614       The second round is from the third, and where
2615       A horrible form of Justice is beheld.
2616     
2617     Clearly to manifest these novel things,
2618       I say that we arrived upon a plain,
2619       Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;
2620     
2621     The dolorous forest is a garland to it
2622       All round about, as the sad moat to that;
2623       There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.
2624     
2625     The soil was of an arid and thick sand,
2626       Not of another fashion made than that
2627       Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.
2628     
2629     Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou
2630       By each one to be dreaded, who doth read
2631       That which was manifest unto mine eyes!
2632     
2633     Of naked souls beheld I many herds,
2634       Who all were weeping very miserably,
2635       And over them seemed set a law diverse.
2636     
2637     Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;
2638       And some were sitting all drawn up together,
2639       And others went about continually.
2640     
2641     Those who were going round were far the more,
2642       And those were less who lay down to their torment,
2643       But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.
2644     
2645     O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,
2646       Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,
2647       As of the snow on Alp without a wind.
2648     
2649     As Alexander, in those torrid parts
2650       Of India, beheld upon his host
2651       Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.
2652     
2653     Whence he provided with his phalanxes
2654       To trample down the soil, because the vapour
2655       Better extinguished was while it was single;
2656     
2657     Thus was descending the eternal heat,
2658       Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder
2659       Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.
2660     
2661     Without repose forever was the dance
2662       Of miserable hands, now there, now here,
2663       Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.
2664     
2665     "Master," began I, "thou who overcomest
2666       All things except the demons dire, that issued
2667       Against us at the entrance of the gate,
2668     
2669     Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not
2670       The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,
2671       So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"
2672     
2673     And he himself, who had become aware
2674       That I was questioning my Guide about him,
2675       Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.
2676     
2677     If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom
2678       He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,
2679       Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,
2680     
2681     And if he wearied out by turns the others
2682       In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,
2683       Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'
2684     
2685     Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,
2686       And shot his bolts at me with all his might,
2687       He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."
2688     
2689     Then did my Leader speak with such great force,
2690       That I had never heard him speak so loud:
2691       "O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished
2692     
2693     Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;
2694       Not any torment, saving thine own rage,
2695       Would be unto thy fury pain complete."
2696     
2697     Then he turned round to me with better lip,
2698       Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he
2699       Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold
2700     
2701     God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;
2702       But, as I said to him, his own despites
2703       Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.
2704     
2705     Now follow me, and mind thou do not place
2706       As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,
2707       But always keep them close unto the wood."
2708     
2709     Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes
2710       Forth from the wood a little rivulet,
2711       Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.
2712     
2713     As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,
2714       The sinful women later share among them,
2715       So downward through the sand it went its way.
2716     
2717     The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,
2718       Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;
2719       Whence I perceived that there the passage was.
2720     
2721     "In all the rest which I have shown to thee
2722       Since we have entered in within the gate
2723       Whose threshold unto no one is denied,
2724     
2725     Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes
2726       So notable as is the present river,
2727       Which all the little flames above it quenches."
2728     
2729     These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him
2730       That he would give me largess of the food,
2731       For which he had given me largess of desire.
2732     
2733     "In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"
2734       Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,
2735       Under whose king the world of old was chaste.
2736     
2737     There is a mountain there, that once was glad
2738       With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;
2739       Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.
2740     
2741     Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle
2742       Of her own son; and to conceal him better,
2743       Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.
2744     
2745     A grand old man stands in the mount erect,
2746       Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,
2747       And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.
2748     
2749     His head is fashioned of refined gold,
2750       And of pure silver are the arms and breast;
2751       Then he is brass as far down as the fork.
2752     
2753     From that point downward all is chosen iron,
2754       Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,
2755       And more he stands on that than on the other.
2756     
2757     Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure
2758       Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,
2759       Which gathered together perforate that cavern.
2760     
2761     From rock to rock they fall into this valley;
2762       Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;
2763       Then downward go along this narrow sluice
2764     
2765     Unto that point where is no more descending.
2766       They form Cocytus; what that pool may be
2767       Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."
2768     
2769     And I to him: "If so the present runnel
2770       Doth take its rise in this way from our world,
2771       Why only on this verge appears it to us?"
2772     
2773     And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,
2774       And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,
2775       Still to the left descending to the bottom,
2776     
2777     Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.
2778       Therefore if something new appear to us,
2779       It should not bring amazement to thy face."
2780     
2781     And I again: "Master, where shall be found
2782       Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,
2783       And sayest the other of this rain is made?"
2784     
2785     "In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"
2786       Replied he; "but the boiling of the red
2787       Water might well solve one of them thou makest.
2788     
2789     Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,
2790       There where the souls repair to lave themselves,
2791       When sin repented of has been removed."
2792     
2793     Then said he: "It is time now to abandon
2794       The wood; take heed that thou come after me;
2795       A way the margins make that are not burning,
2796     
2797     And over them all vapours are extinguished."
2798     
2799     
2800     
2801     Inferno: Canto XV
2802     
2803     
2804     Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,
2805       And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,
2806       From fire it saves the water and the dikes.
2807     
2808     Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,
2809       Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,
2810       Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;
2811     
2812     And as the Paduans along the Brenta,
2813       To guard their villas and their villages,
2814       Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;
2815     
2816     In such similitude had those been made,
2817       Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,
2818       Whoever he might be, the master made them.
2819     
2820     Now were we from the forest so remote,
2821       I could not have discovered where it was,
2822       Even if backward I had turned myself,
2823     
2824     When we a company of souls encountered,
2825       Who came beside the dike, and every one
2826       Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont
2827     
2828     To eye each other under a new moon,
2829       And so towards us sharpened they their brows
2830       As an old tailor at the needle's eye.
2831     
2832     Thus scrutinised by such a family,
2833       By some one I was recognised, who seized
2834       My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"
2835     
2836     And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,
2837       On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,
2838       That the scorched countenance prevented not
2839     
2840     His recognition by my intellect;
2841       And bowing down my face unto his own,
2842       I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"
2843     
2844     And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,
2845       If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini
2846       Backward return and let the trail go on."
2847     
2848     I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;
2849       And if you wish me to sit down with you,
2850       I will, if he please, for I go with him."
2851     
2852     "O son," he said, "whoever of this herd
2853       A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,
2854       Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.
2855     
2856     Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,
2857       And afterward will I rejoin my band,
2858       Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."
2859     
2860     I did not dare to go down from the road
2861       Level to walk with him; but my head bowed
2862       I held as one who goeth reverently.
2863     
2864     And he began: "What fortune or what fate
2865       Before the last day leadeth thee down here?
2866       And who is this that showeth thee the way?"
2867     
2868     "Up there above us in the life serene,"
2869       I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,
2870       Or ever yet my age had been completed.
2871     
2872     But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;
2873       This one appeared to me, returning thither,
2874       And homeward leadeth me along this road."
2875     
2876     And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,
2877       Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,
2878       If well I judged in the life beautiful.
2879     
2880     And if I had not died so prematurely,
2881       Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,
2882       I would have given thee comfort in the work.
2883     
2884     But that ungrateful and malignant people,
2885       Which of old time from Fesole descended,
2886       And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,
2887     
2888     Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;
2889       And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs
2890       It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.
2891     
2892     Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;
2893       A people avaricious, envious, proud;
2894       Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.
2895     
2896     Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,
2897       One party and the other shall be hungry
2898       For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.
2899     
2900     Their litter let the beasts of Fesole
2901       Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,
2902       If any still upon their dunghill rise,
2903     
2904     In which may yet revive the consecrated
2905       Seed of those Romans, who remained there when
2906       The nest of such great malice it became."
2907     
2908     "If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"
2909       Replied I to him, "not yet would you be
2910       In banishment from human nature placed;
2911     
2912     For in my mind is fixed, and touches now
2913       My heart the dear and good paternal image
2914       Of you, when in the world from hour to hour
2915     
2916     You taught me how a man becomes eternal;
2917       And how much I am grateful, while I live
2918       Behoves that in my language be discerned.
2919     
2920     What you narrate of my career I write,
2921       And keep it to be glossed with other text
2922       By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.
2923     
2924     This much will I have manifest to you;
2925       Provided that my conscience do not chide me,
2926       For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.
2927     
2928     Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;
2929       Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around
2930       As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."
2931     
2932     My Master thereupon on his right cheek
2933       Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;
2934       Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."
2935     
2936     Nor speaking less on that account, I go
2937       With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are
2938       His most known and most eminent companions.
2939     
2940     And he to me: "To know of some is well;
2941       Of others it were laudable to be silent,
2942       For short would be the time for so much speech.
2943     
2944     Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,
2945       And men of letters great and of great fame,
2946       In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.
2947     
2948     Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,
2949       And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there
2950       If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,
2951     
2952     That one, who by the Servant of the Servants
2953       From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,
2954       Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.
2955     
2956     More would I say, but coming and discoursing
2957       Can be no longer; for that I behold
2958       New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.
2959     
2960     A people comes with whom I may not be;
2961       Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,
2962       In which I still live, and no more I ask."
2963     
2964     Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those
2965       Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle
2966       Across the plain; and seemed to be among them
2967     
2968     The one who wins, and not the one who loses.
2969     
2970     
2971     
2972     Inferno: Canto XVI
2973     
2974     
2975     Now was I where was heard the reverberation
2976       Of water falling into the next round,
2977       Like to that humming which the beehives make,
2978     
2979     When shadows three together started forth,
2980       Running, from out a company that passed
2981       Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.
2982     
2983     Towards us came they, and each one cried out:
2984       "Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest
2985       To be some one of our depraved city."
2986     
2987     Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,
2988       Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!
2989       It pains me still but to remember it.
2990     
2991     Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;
2992       He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"
2993       He said; "to these we should be courteous.
2994     
2995     And if it were not for the fire that darts
2996       The nature of this region, I should say
2997       That haste were more becoming thee than them."
2998     
2999     As soon as we stood still, they recommenced
3000       The old refrain, and when they overtook us,
3001       Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.
3002     
3003     As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,
3004       Watching for their advantage and their hold,
3005       Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,
3006     
3007     Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage
3008       Direct to me, so that in opposite wise
3009       His neck and feet continual journey made.
3010     
3011     And, "If the misery of this soft place
3012       Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"
3013       Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,
3014     
3015     Let the renown of us thy mind incline
3016       To tell us who thou art, who thus securely
3017       Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.
3018     
3019     He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,
3020       Naked and skinless though he now may go,
3021       Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;
3022     
3023     He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;
3024       His name was Guidoguerra, and in life
3025       Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.
3026     
3027     The other, who close by me treads the sand,
3028       Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame
3029       Above there in the world should welcome be.
3030     
3031     And I, who with them on the cross am placed,
3032       Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly
3033       My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."
3034     
3035     Could I have been protected from the fire,
3036       Below I should have thrown myself among them,
3037       And think the Teacher would have suffered it;
3038     
3039     But as I should have burned and baked myself,
3040       My terror overmastered my good will,
3041       Which made me greedy of embracing them.
3042     
3043     Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain
3044       Did your condition fix within me so,
3045       That tardily it wholly is stripped off,
3046     
3047     As soon as this my Lord said unto me
3048       Words, on account of which I thought within me
3049       That people such as you are were approaching.
3050     
3051     I of your city am; and evermore
3052       Your labours and your honourable names
3053       I with affection have retraced and heard.
3054     
3055     I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits
3056       Promised to me by the veracious Leader;
3057       But to the centre first I needs must plunge."
3058     
3059     "So may the soul for a long while conduct
3060       Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,
3061       "And so may thy renown shine after thee,
3062     
3063     Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell
3064       Within our city, as they used to do,
3065       Or if they wholly have gone out of it;
3066     
3067     For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment
3068       With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,
3069       Doth greatly mortify us with his words."
3070     
3071     "The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,
3072       Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,
3073       Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"
3074     
3075     In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;
3076       And the three, taking that for my reply,
3077       Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.
3078     
3079     "If other times so little it doth cost thee,"
3080       Replied they all, "to satisfy another,
3081       Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!
3082     
3083     Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,
3084       And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,
3085       When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'
3086     
3087     See that thou speak of us unto the people."
3088       Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight
3089       It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.
3090     
3091     Not an Amen could possibly be said
3092       So rapidly as they had disappeared;
3093       Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.
3094     
3095     I followed him, and little had we gone,
3096       Before the sound of water was so near us,
3097       That speaking we should hardly have been heard.
3098     
3099     Even as that stream which holdeth its own course
3100       The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,
3101       Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,
3102     
3103     Which is above called Acquacheta, ere
3104       It down descendeth into its low bed,
3105       And at Forli is vacant of that name,
3106     
3107     Reverberates there above San Benedetto
3108       From Alps, by falling at a single leap,
3109       Where for a thousand there were room enough;
3110     
3111     Thus downward from a bank precipitate,
3112       We found resounding that dark-tinted water,
3113       So that it soon the ear would have offended.
3114     
3115     I had a cord around about me girt,
3116       And therewithal I whilom had designed
3117       To take the panther with the painted skin.
3118     
3119     After I this had all from me unloosed,
3120       As my Conductor had commanded me,
3121       I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,
3122     
3123     Whereat he turned himself to the right side,
3124       And at a little distance from the verge,
3125       He cast it down into that deep abyss.
3126     
3127     "It must needs be some novelty respond,"
3128       I said within myself, "to the new signal
3129       The Master with his eye is following so."
3130     
3131     Ah me! how very cautious men should be
3132       With those who not alone behold the act,
3133       But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!
3134     
3135     He said to me: "Soon there will upward come
3136       What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming
3137       Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."
3138     
3139     Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,
3140       A man should close his lips as far as may be,
3141       Because without his fault it causes shame;
3142     
3143     But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes
3144       Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,
3145       So may they not be void of lasting favour,
3146     
3147     Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere
3148       I saw a figure swimming upward come,
3149       Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,
3150     
3151     Even as he returns who goeth down
3152       Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled
3153       Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,
3154     
3155     Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.
3156     
3157     
3158     
3159     Inferno: Canto XVII
3160     
3161     
3162     "Behold the monster with the pointed tail,
3163       Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,
3164       Behold him who infecteth all the world."
3165     
3166     Thus unto me my Guide began to say,
3167       And beckoned him that he should come to shore,
3168       Near to the confine of the trodden marble;
3169     
3170     And that uncleanly image of deceit
3171       Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,
3172       But on the border did not drag its tail.
3173     
3174     The face was as the face of a just man,
3175       Its semblance outwardly was so benign,
3176       And of a serpent all the trunk beside.
3177     
3178     Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;
3179       The back, and breast, and both the sides it had
3180       Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.
3181     
3182     With colours more, groundwork or broidery
3183       Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,
3184       Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.
3185     
3186     As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,
3187       That part are in the water, part on land;
3188       And as among the guzzling Germans there,
3189     
3190     The beaver plants himself to wage his war;
3191       So that vile monster lay upon the border,
3192       Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.
3193     
3194     His tail was wholly quivering in the void,
3195       Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,
3196       That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.
3197     
3198     The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside
3199       Our way a little, even to that beast
3200       Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."
3201     
3202     We therefore on the right side descended,
3203       And made ten steps upon the outer verge,
3204       Completely to avoid the sand and flame;
3205     
3206     And after we are come to him, I see
3207       A little farther off upon the sand
3208       A people sitting near the hollow place.
3209     
3210     Then said to me the Master: "So that full
3211       Experience of this round thou bear away,
3212       Now go and see what their condition is.
3213     
3214     There let thy conversation be concise;
3215       Till thou returnest I will speak with him,
3216       That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."
3217     
3218     Thus farther still upon the outermost
3219       Head of that seventh circle all alone
3220       I went, where sat the melancholy folk.
3221     
3222     Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;
3223       This way, that way, they helped them with their hands
3224       Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.
3225     
3226     Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,
3227       Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when
3228       By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.
3229     
3230     When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces
3231       Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,
3232       Not one of them I knew; but I perceived
3233     
3234     That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,
3235       Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;
3236       And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.
3237     
3238     And as I gazing round me come among them,
3239       Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw
3240       That had the face and posture of a lion.
3241     
3242     Proceeding then the current of my sight,
3243       Another of them saw I, red as blood,
3244       Display a goose more white than butter is.
3245     
3246     And one, who with an azure sow and gravid
3247       Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,
3248       Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?
3249     
3250     Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,
3251       Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,
3252       Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.
3253     
3254     A Paduan am I with these Florentines;
3255       Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,
3256       Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,
3257     
3258     He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"
3259       Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust
3260       His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.
3261     
3262     And fearing lest my longer stay might vex
3263       Him who had warned me not to tarry long,
3264       Backward I turned me from those weary souls.
3265     
3266     I found my Guide, who had already mounted
3267       Upon the back of that wild animal,
3268       And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.
3269     
3270     Now we descend by stairways such as these;
3271       Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,
3272       So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."
3273     
3274     Such as he is who has so near the ague
3275       Of quartan that his nails are blue already,
3276       And trembles all, but looking at the shade;
3277     
3278     Even such became I at those proffered words;
3279       But shame in me his menaces produced,
3280       Which maketh servant strong before good master.
3281     
3282     I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;
3283       I wished to say, and yet the voice came not
3284       As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."
3285     
3286     But he, who other times had rescued me
3287       In other peril, soon as I had mounted,
3288       Within his arms encircled and sustained me,
3289     
3290     And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;
3291       The circles large, and the descent be little;
3292       Think of the novel burden which thou hast."
3293     
3294     Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,
3295       Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;
3296       And when he wholly felt himself afloat,
3297     
3298     There where his breast had been he turned his tail,
3299       And that extended like an eel he moved,
3300       And with his paws drew to himself the air.
3301     
3302     A greater fear I do not think there was
3303       What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,
3304       Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;
3305     
3306     Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks
3307       Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,
3308       His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"
3309     
3310     Than was my own, when I perceived myself
3311       On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished
3312       The sight of everything but of the monster.
3313     
3314     Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;
3315       Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only
3316       By wind upon my face and from below.
3317     
3318     I heard already on the right the whirlpool
3319       Making a horrible crashing under us;
3320       Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.
3321     
3322     Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;
3323       Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,
3324       Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.
3325     
3326     I saw then, for before I had not seen it,
3327       The turning and descending, by great horrors
3328       That were approaching upon divers sides.
3329     
3330     As falcon who has long been on the wing,
3331       Who, without seeing either lure or bird,
3332       Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"
3333     
3334     Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,
3335       Thorough a hundred circles, and alights
3336       Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;
3337     
3338     Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,
3339       Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,
3340       And being disencumbered of our persons,
3341     
3342     He sped away as arrow from the string.
3343     
3344     
3345     
3346     Inferno: Canto XVIII
3347     
3348     
3349     There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,
3350       Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,
3351       As is the circle that around it turns.
3352     
3353     Right in the middle of the field malign
3354       There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,
3355       Of which its place the structure will recount.
3356     
3357     Round, then, is that enclosure which remains
3358       Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,
3359       And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.
3360     
3361     As where for the protection of the walls
3362       Many and many moats surround the castles,
3363       The part in which they are a figure forms,
3364     
3365     Just such an image those presented there;
3366       And as about such strongholds from their gates
3367       Unto the outer bank are little bridges,
3368     
3369     So from the precipice's base did crags
3370       Project, which intersected dikes and moats,
3371       Unto the well that truncates and collects them.
3372     
3373     Within this place, down shaken from the back
3374       Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet
3375       Held to the left, and I moved on behind.
3376     
3377     Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,
3378       New torments, and new wielders of the lash,
3379       Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.
3380     
3381     Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;
3382       This side the middle came they facing us,
3383       Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;
3384     
3385     Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,
3386       The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,
3387       Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;
3388     
3389     For all upon one side towards the Castle
3390       Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;
3391       On the other side they go towards the Mountain.
3392     
3393     This side and that, along the livid stone
3394       Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,
3395       Who cruelly were beating them behind.
3396     
3397     Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs
3398       At the first blows! and sooth not any one
3399       The second waited for, nor for the third.
3400     
3401     While I was going on, mine eyes by one
3402       Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already
3403       With sight of this one I am not unfed."
3404     
3405     Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,
3406       And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,
3407       And to my going somewhat back assented;
3408     
3409     And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,
3410       Lowering his face, but little it availed him;
3411       For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,
3412     
3413     If false are not the features which thou bearest,
3414       Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;
3415       But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"
3416     
3417     And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;
3418       But forces me thine utterance distinct,
3419       Which makes me recollect the ancient world.
3420     
3421     I was the one who the fair Ghisola
3422       Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,
3423       Howe'er the shameless story may be told.
3424     
3425     Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;
3426       Nay, rather is this place so full of them,
3427       That not so many tongues to-day are taught
3428     
3429     'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'
3430       And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,
3431       Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart."
3432     
3433     While speaking in this manner, with his scourge
3434       A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone
3435       Pander, there are no women here for coin."
3436     
3437     I joined myself again unto mine Escort;
3438       Thereafterward with footsteps few we came
3439       To where a crag projected from the bank.
3440     
3441     This very easily did we ascend,
3442       And turning to the right along its ridge,
3443       From those eternal circles we departed.
3444     
3445     When we were there, where it is hollowed out
3446       Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,
3447       The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike
3448     
3449     The vision of those others evil-born,
3450       Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,
3451       Because together with us they have gone."
3452     
3453     From the old bridge we looked upon the train
3454       Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,
3455       And which the scourges in like manner smite.
3456     
3457     And the good Master, without my inquiring,
3458       Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,
3459       And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;
3460     
3461     Still what a royal aspect he retains!
3462       That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning
3463       The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.
3464     
3465     He by the isle of Lemnos passed along
3466       After the daring women pitiless
3467       Had unto death devoted all their males.
3468     
3469     There with his tokens and with ornate words
3470       Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden
3471       Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.
3472     
3473     There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;
3474       Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,
3475       And also for Medea is vengeance done.
3476     
3477     With him go those who in such wise deceive;
3478       And this sufficient be of the first valley
3479       To know, and those that in its jaws it holds."
3480     
3481     We were already where the narrow path
3482       Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms
3483       Of that a buttress for another arch.
3484     
3485     Thence we heard people, who are making moan
3486       In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,
3487       And with their palms beating upon themselves
3488     
3489     The margins were incrusted with a mould
3490       By exhalation from below, that sticks there,
3491       And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.
3492     
3493     The bottom is so deep, no place suffices
3494       To give us sight of it, without ascending
3495       The arch's back, where most the crag impends.
3496     
3497     Thither we came, and thence down in the moat
3498       I saw a people smothered in a filth
3499       That out of human privies seemed to flow;
3500     
3501     And whilst below there with mine eye I search,
3502       I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,
3503       It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.
3504     
3505     He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager
3506       To look at me more than the other foul ones?"
3507       And I to him: "Because, if I remember,
3508     
3509     I have already seen thee with dry hair,
3510       And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;
3511       Therefore I eye thee more than all the others."
3512     
3513     And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:
3514       "The flatteries have submerged me here below,
3515       Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited."
3516     
3517     Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust
3518       Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,
3519       That with thine eyes thou well the face attain
3520     
3521     Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,
3522       Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,
3523       And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.
3524     
3525     Thais the harlot is it, who replied
3526       Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I
3527       Great gratitude from thee?'--'Nay, marvellous;'
3528     
3529     And herewith let our sight be satisfied."
3530     
3531     
3532     
3533     Inferno: Canto XIX
3534     
3535     
3536     O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,
3537       Ye who the things of God, which ought to be
3538       The brides of holiness, rapaciously
3539     
3540     For silver and for gold do prostitute,
3541       Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,
3542       Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.
3543     
3544     We had already on the following tomb
3545       Ascended to that portion of the crag
3546       Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.
3547     
3548     Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest
3549       In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,
3550       And with what justice doth thy power distribute!
3551     
3552     I saw upon the sides and on the bottom
3553       The livid stone with perforations filled,
3554       All of one size, and every one was round.
3555     
3556     To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater
3557       Than those that in my beautiful Saint John
3558       Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,
3559     
3560     And one of which, not many years ago,
3561       I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;
3562       Be this a seal all men to undeceive.
3563     
3564     Out of the mouth of each one there protruded
3565       The feet of a transgressor, and the legs
3566       Up to the calf, the rest within remained.
3567     
3568     In all of them the soles were both on fire;
3569       Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,
3570       They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.
3571     
3572     Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont
3573       To move upon the outer surface only,
3574       So likewise was it there from heel to point.
3575     
3576     "Master, who is that one who writhes himself,
3577       More than his other comrades quivering,"
3578       I said, "and whom a redder flame is sucking?"
3579     
3580     And he to me: "If thou wilt have me bear thee
3581       Down there along that bank which lowest lies,
3582       From him thou'lt know his errors and himself."
3583     
3584     And I: "What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;
3585       Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not
3586       From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken."
3587     
3588     Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;
3589       We turned, and on the left-hand side descended
3590       Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.
3591     
3592     And the good Master yet from off his haunch
3593       Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me
3594       Of him who so lamented with his shanks.
3595     
3596     "Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,
3597       O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,"
3598       To say began I, "if thou canst, speak out."
3599     
3600     I stood even as the friar who is confessing
3601       The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,
3602       Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.
3603     
3604     And he cried out: "Dost thou stand there already,
3605       Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?
3606       By many years the record lied to me.
3607     
3608     Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,
3609       For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud
3610       The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?"
3611     
3612     Such I became, as people are who stand,
3613       Not comprehending what is answered them,
3614       As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.
3615     
3616     Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,
3617       'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"
3618       And I replied as was imposed on me.
3619     
3620     Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,
3621       Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation
3622       Said to me: "Then what wantest thou of me?
3623     
3624     If who I am thou carest so much to know,
3625       That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,
3626       Know that I vested was with the great mantle;
3627     
3628     And truly was I son of the She-bear,
3629       So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
3630       Above, and here myself, I pocketed.
3631     
3632     Beneath my head the others are dragged down
3633       Who have preceded me in simony,
3634       Flattened along the fissure of the rock.
3635     
3636     Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever
3637       That one shall come who I believed thou wast,
3638       What time the sudden question I proposed.
3639     
3640     But longer I my feet already toast,
3641       And here have been in this way upside down,
3642       Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;
3643     
3644     For after him shall come of fouler deed
3645       From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,
3646       Such as befits to cover him and me.
3647     
3648     New Jason will he be, of whom we read
3649       In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,
3650       So he who governs France shall be to this one."
3651     
3652     I do not know if I were here too bold,
3653       That him I answered only in this metre:
3654       "I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure
3655     
3656     Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,
3657       Before he put the keys into his keeping?
3658       Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'
3659     
3660     Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias
3661       Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen
3662       Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.
3663     
3664     Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,
3665       And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,
3666       Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.
3667     
3668     And were it not that still forbids it me
3669       The reverence for the keys superlative
3670       Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,
3671     
3672     I would make use of words more grievous still;
3673       Because your avarice afflicts the world,
3674       Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.
3675     
3676     The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,
3677       When she who sitteth upon many waters
3678       To fornicate with kings by him was seen;
3679     
3680     The same who with the seven heads was born,
3681       And power and strength from the ten horns received,
3682       So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.
3683     
3684     Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;
3685       And from the idolater how differ ye,
3686       Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?
3687     
3688     Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,
3689       Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower
3690       Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!"
3691     
3692     And while I sang to him such notes as these,
3693       Either that anger or that conscience stung him,
3694       He struggled violently with both his feet.
3695     
3696     I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,
3697       With such contented lip he listened ever
3698       Unto the sound of the true words expressed.
3699     
3700     Therefore with both his arms he took me up,
3701       And when he had me all upon his breast,
3702       Remounted by the way where he descended.
3703     
3704     Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;
3705       But bore me to the summit of the arch
3706       Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.
3707     
3708     There tenderly he laid his burden down,
3709       Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,
3710       That would have been hard passage for the goats:
3711     
3712     Thence was unveiled to me another valley.
3713     
3714     
3715     
3716     Inferno: Canto XX
3717     
3718     
3719     Of a new pain behoves me to make verses
3720       And give material to the twentieth canto
3721       Of the first song, which is of the submerged.
3722     
3723     I was already thoroughly disposed
3724       To peer down into the uncovered depth,
3725       Which bathed itself with tears of agony;
3726     
3727     And people saw I through the circular valley,
3728       Silent and weeping, coming at the pace
3729       Which in this world the Litanies assume.
3730     
3731     As lower down my sight descended on them,
3732       Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted
3733       From chin to the beginning of the chest;
3734     
3735     For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,
3736       And backward it behoved them to advance,
3737       As to look forward had been taken from them.
3738     
3739     Perchance indeed by violence of palsy
3740       Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;
3741       But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be.
3742     
3743     As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit
3744       From this thy reading, think now for thyself
3745       How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,
3746     
3747     When our own image near me I beheld
3748       Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes
3749       Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.
3750     
3751     Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak
3752       Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said
3753       To me: "Art thou, too, of the other fools?
3754     
3755     Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;
3756       Who is a greater reprobate than he
3757       Who feels compassion at the doom divine?
3758     
3759     Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom
3760       Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes;
3761       Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou,
3762     
3763     Amphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?'
3764       And downward ceased he not to fall amain
3765       As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.
3766     
3767     See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!
3768       Because he wished to see too far before him
3769       Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:
3770     
3771     Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,
3772       When from a male a female he became,
3773       His members being all of them transformed;
3774     
3775     And afterwards was forced to strike once more
3776       The two entangled serpents with his rod,
3777       Ere he could have again his manly plumes.
3778     
3779     That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,
3780       Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs
3781       The Carrarese who houses underneath,
3782     
3783     Among the marbles white a cavern had
3784       For his abode; whence to behold the stars
3785       And sea, the view was not cut off from him.
3786     
3787     And she there, who is covering up her breasts,
3788       Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,
3789       And on that side has all the hairy skin,
3790     
3791     Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,
3792       Afterwards tarried there where I was born;
3793       Whereof I would thou list to me a little.
3794     
3795     After her father had from life departed,
3796       And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,
3797       She a long season wandered through the world.
3798     
3799     Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake
3800       At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany
3801       Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.
3802     
3803     By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,
3804       'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,
3805       With water that grows stagnant in that lake.
3806     
3807     Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,
3808       And he of Brescia, and the Veronese
3809       Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.
3810     
3811     Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,
3812       To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,
3813       Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.
3814     
3815     There of necessity must fall whatever
3816       In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,
3817       And grows a river down through verdant pastures.
3818     
3819     Soon as the water doth begin to run,
3820       No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,
3821       Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.
3822     
3823     Not far it runs before it finds a plain
3824       In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,
3825       And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.
3826     
3827     Passing that way the virgin pitiless
3828       Land in the middle of the fen descried,
3829       Untilled and naked of inhabitants;
3830     
3831     There to escape all human intercourse,
3832       She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise
3833       And lived, and left her empty body there.
3834     
3835     The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,
3836       Collected in that place, which was made strong
3837       By the lagoon it had on every side;
3838     
3839     They built their city over those dead bones,
3840       And, after her who first the place selected,
3841       Mantua named it, without other omen.
3842     
3843     Its people once within more crowded were,
3844       Ere the stupidity of Casalodi
3845       From Pinamonte had received deceit.
3846     
3847     Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest
3848       Originate my city otherwise,
3849       No falsehood may the verity defraud."
3850     
3851     And I: "My Master, thy discourses are
3852       To me so certain, and so take my faith,
3853       That unto me the rest would be spent coals.
3854     
3855     But tell me of the people who are passing,
3856       If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,
3857       For only unto that my mind reverts."
3858     
3859     Then said he to me: "He who from the cheek
3860       Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders
3861       Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,
3862     
3863     So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,
3864       An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,
3865       In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.
3866     
3867     Eryphylus his name was, and so sings
3868       My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;
3869       That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.
3870     
3871     The next, who is so slender in the flanks,
3872       Was Michael Scott, who of a verity
3873       Of magical illusions knew the game.
3874     
3875     Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,
3876       Who now unto his leather and his thread
3877       Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.
3878     
3879     Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,
3880       The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;
3881       They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.
3882     
3883     But come now, for already holds the confines
3884       Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville
3885       Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,
3886     
3887     And yesternight the moon was round already;
3888       Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee
3889       From time to time within the forest deep."
3890     
3891     Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.
3892     
3893     
3894     
3895     Inferno: Canto XXI
3896     
3897     
3898     From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things
3899       Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,
3900       We came along, and held the summit, when
3901     
3902     We halted to behold another fissure
3903       Of Malebolge and other vain laments;
3904       And I beheld it marvellously dark.
3905     
3906     As in the Arsenal of the Venetians
3907       Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch
3908       To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,
3909     
3910     For sail they cannot; and instead thereof
3911       One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks
3912       The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;
3913     
3914     One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,
3915       This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,
3916       Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;
3917     
3918     Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,
3919       Was boiling down below there a dense pitch
3920       Which upon every side the bank belimed.
3921     
3922     I saw it, but I did not see within it
3923       Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,
3924       And all swell up and resubside compressed.
3925     
3926     The while below there fixedly I gazed,
3927       My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"
3928       Drew me unto himself from where I stood.
3929     
3930     Then I turned round, as one who is impatient
3931       To see what it behoves him to escape,
3932       And whom a sudden terror doth unman,
3933     
3934     Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;
3935       And I beheld behind us a black devil,
3936       Running along upon the crag, approach.
3937     
3938     Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!
3939       And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,
3940       With open wings and light upon his feet!
3941     
3942     His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,
3943       A sinner did encumber with both haunches,
3944       And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.
3945     
3946     From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,
3947       Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;
3948       Plunge him beneath, for I return for others
3949     
3950     Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.
3951       All there are barrators, except Bonturo;
3952       No into Yes for money there is changed."
3953     
3954     He hurled him down, and over the hard crag
3955       Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened
3956       In so much hurry to pursue a thief.
3957     
3958     The other sank, and rose again face downward;
3959       But the demons, under cover of the bridge,
3960       Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!
3961     
3962     Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;
3963       Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,
3964       Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."
3965     
3966     They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;
3967       They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,
3968       That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."
3969     
3970     Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make
3971       Immerse into the middle of the caldron
3972       The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.
3973     
3974     Said the good Master to me: "That it be not
3975       Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down
3976       Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;
3977     
3978     And for no outrage that is done to me
3979       Be thou afraid, because these things I know,
3980       For once before was I in such a scuffle."
3981     
3982     Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,
3983       And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,
3984       Need was for him to have a steadfast front.
3985     
3986     With the same fury, and the same uproar,
3987       As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,
3988       Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,
3989     
3990     They issued from beneath the little bridge,
3991       And turned against him all their grappling-irons;
3992       But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!
3993     
3994     Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,
3995       Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,
3996       And then take counsel as to grappling me."
3997     
3998     They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"
3999       Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,
4000       And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"
4001     
4002     "Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me
4003       Advanced into this place," my Master said,
4004       "Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,
4005     
4006     Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?
4007       Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed
4008       That I another show this savage road."
4009     
4010     Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,
4011       That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,
4012       And to the others said: "Now strike him not."
4013     
4014     And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest
4015       Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,
4016       Securely now return to me again."
4017     
4018     Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;
4019       And all the devils forward thrust themselves,
4020       So that I feared they would not keep their compact.
4021     
4022     And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers
4023       Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,
4024       Seeing themselves among so many foes.
4025     
4026     Close did I press myself with all my person
4027       Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes
4028       From off their countenance, which was not good.
4029     
4030     They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"
4031       They said to one another, "on the rump?"
4032       And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."
4033     
4034     But the same demon who was holding parley
4035       With my Conductor turned him very quickly,
4036       And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"
4037     
4038     Then said to us: "You can no farther go
4039       Forward upon this crag, because is lying
4040       All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.
4041     
4042     And if it still doth please you to go onward,
4043       Pursue your way along upon this rock;
4044       Near is another crag that yields a path.
4045     
4046     Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,
4047       One thousand and two hundred sixty-six
4048       Years were complete, that here the way was broken.
4049     
4050     I send in that direction some of mine
4051       To see if any one doth air himself;
4052       Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.
4053     
4054     Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"
4055       Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;
4056       And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.
4057     
4058     Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,
4059       And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,
4060       And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;
4061     
4062     Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;
4063       Let these be safe as far as the next crag,
4064       That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."
4065     
4066     "O me! what is it, Master, that I see?
4067       Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,
4068       If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.
4069     
4070     If thou art as observant as thy wont is,
4071       Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,
4072       And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"
4073     
4074     And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;
4075       Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,
4076       Because they do it for those boiling wretches."
4077     
4078     Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;
4079       But first had each one thrust his tongue between
4080       His teeth towards their leader for a signal;
4081     
4082     And he had made a trumpet of his rump.
4083     
4084     
4085     
4086     Inferno: Canto XXII
4087     
4088     
4089     I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,
4090       Begin the storming, and their muster make,
4091       And sometimes starting off for their escape;
4092     
4093     Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,
4094       O Aretines, and foragers go forth,
4095       Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,
4096     
4097     Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,
4098       With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,
4099       And with our own, and with outlandish things,
4100     
4101     But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth
4102       Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,
4103       Nor ship by any sign of land or star.
4104     
4105     We went upon our way with the ten demons;
4106       Ah, savage company! but in the church
4107       With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!
4108     
4109     Ever upon the pitch was my intent,
4110       To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,
4111       And of the people who therein were burned.
4112     
4113     Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign
4114       To mariners by arching of the back,
4115       That they should counsel take to save their vessel,
4116     
4117     Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,
4118       One of the sinners would display his back,
4119       And in less time conceal it than it lightens.
4120     
4121     As on the brink of water in a ditch
4122       The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,
4123       So that they hide their feet and other bulk,
4124     
4125     So upon every side the sinners stood;
4126       But ever as Barbariccia near them came,
4127       Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.
4128     
4129     I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,
4130       One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass
4131       One frog remains, and down another dives;
4132     
4133     And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,
4134       Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,
4135       And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.
4136     
4137     I knew, before, the names of all of them,
4138       So had I noted them when they were chosen,
4139       And when they called each other, listened how.
4140     
4141     "O Rubicante, see that thou do lay
4142       Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,"
4143       Cried all together the accursed ones.
4144     
4145     And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,
4146       That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,
4147       Thus come into his adversaries' hands."
4148     
4149     Near to the side of him my Leader drew,
4150       Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:
4151       "I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;
4152     
4153     My mother placed me servant to a lord,
4154       For she had borne me to a ribald knave,
4155       Destroyer of himself and of his things.
4156     
4157     Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;
4158       I set me there to practise barratry,
4159       For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."
4160     
4161     And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,
4162       On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,
4163       Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.
4164     
4165     Among malicious cats the mouse had come;
4166       But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,
4167       And said: "Stand ye aside, while I enfork him."
4168     
4169     And to my Master he turned round his head;
4170       "Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish
4171       To know from him, before some one destroy him."
4172     
4173     The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;
4174       Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,
4175       Under the pitch?"  And he: "I separated
4176     
4177     Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;
4178       Would that I still were covered up with him,
4179       For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"
4180     
4181     And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"
4182       And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,
4183       So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.
4184     
4185     Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him
4186       Down at the legs; whence their Decurion
4187       Turned round and round about with evil look.
4188     
4189     When they again somewhat were pacified,
4190       Of him, who still was looking at his wound,
4191       Demanded my Conductor without stay:
4192     
4193     "Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting
4194       Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"
4195       And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,
4196     
4197     He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,
4198       Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,
4199       And dealt so with them each exults thereat;
4200     
4201     Money he took, and let them smoothly off,
4202       As he says; and in other offices
4203       A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.
4204     
4205     Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche
4206       Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia
4207       To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.
4208     
4209     O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;
4210       Still farther would I speak, but am afraid
4211       Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."
4212     
4213     And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,
4214       Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,
4215       Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."
4216     
4217     "If you desire either to see or hear,"
4218       The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,
4219       "Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.
4220     
4221     But let the Malebranche cease a little,
4222       So that these may not their revenges fear,
4223       And I, down sitting in this very place,
4224     
4225     For one that I am will make seven come,
4226       When I shall whistle, as our custom is
4227       To do whenever one of us comes out."
4228     
4229     Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,
4230       Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick
4231       Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"
4232     
4233     Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,
4234       Responded: "I by far too cunning am,
4235       When I procure for mine a greater sadness."
4236     
4237     Alichin held not in, but running counter
4238       Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,
4239       I will not follow thee upon the gallop,
4240     
4241     But I will beat my wings above the pitch;
4242       The height be left, and be the bank a shield
4243       To see if thou alone dost countervail us."
4244     
4245     O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!
4246       Each to the other side his eyes averted;
4247       He first, who most reluctant was to do it.
4248     
4249     The Navarrese selected well his time;
4250       Planted his feet on land, and in a moment
4251       Leaped, and released himself from their design.
4252     
4253     Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,
4254       But he most who was cause of the defeat;
4255       Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."
4256     
4257     But little it availed, for wings could not
4258       Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,
4259       And, flying, upward he his breast directed;
4260     
4261     Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden
4262       Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,
4263       And upward he returneth cross and weary.
4264     
4265     Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina
4266       Flying behind him followed close, desirous
4267       The other should escape, to have a quarrel.
4268     
4269     And when the barrator had disappeared,
4270       He turned his talons upon his companion,
4271       And grappled with him right above the moat.
4272     
4273     But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk
4274       To clapperclaw him well; and both of them
4275       Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.
4276     
4277     A sudden intercessor was the heat;
4278       But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,
4279       To such degree they had their wings belimed.
4280     
4281     Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia
4282       Made four of them fly to the other side
4283       With all their gaffs, and very speedily
4284     
4285     This side and that they to their posts descended;
4286       They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,
4287       Who were already baked within the crust,
4288     
4289     And in this manner busied did we leave them.
4290     
4291     
4292     
4293     Inferno: Canto XXIII
4294     
4295     
4296     Silent, alone, and without company
4297       We went, the one in front, the other after,
4298       As go the Minor Friars along their way.
4299     
4300     Upon the fable of Aesop was directed
4301       My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,
4302       Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;
4303     
4304     For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike
4305       Than this one is to that, if well we couple
4306       End and beginning with a steadfast mind.
4307     
4308     And even as one thought from another springs,
4309       So afterward from that was born another,
4310       Which the first fear within me double made.
4311     
4312     Thus did I ponder: "These on our account
4313       Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff
4314       So great, that much I think it must annoy them.
4315     
4316     If anger be engrafted on ill-will,
4317       They will come after us more merciless
4318       Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"
4319     
4320     I felt my hair stand all on end already
4321       With terror, and stood backwardly intent,
4322       When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not
4323     
4324     Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche
4325       I am in dread; we have them now behind us;
4326       I so imagine them, I already feel them."
4327     
4328     And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,
4329       Thine outward image I should not attract
4330       Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.
4331     
4332     Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,
4333       With similar attitude and similar face,
4334       So that of both one counsel sole I made.
4335     
4336     If peradventure the right bank so slope
4337       That we to the next Bolgia can descend,
4338       We shall escape from the imagined chase."
4339     
4340     Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,
4341       When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,
4342       Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.
4343     
4344     My Leader on a sudden seized me up,
4345       Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,
4346       And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,
4347     
4348     Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,
4349       Having more care of him than of herself,
4350       So that she clothes her only with a shift;
4351     
4352     And downward from the top of the hard bank
4353       Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,
4354       That one side of the other Bolgia walls.
4355     
4356     Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice
4357       To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,
4358       When nearest to the paddles it approaches,
4359     
4360     As did my Master down along that border,
4361       Bearing me with him on his breast away,
4362       As his own son, and not as a companion.
4363     
4364     Hardly the bed of the ravine below
4365       His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill
4366       Right over us; but he was not afraid;
4367     
4368     For the high Providence, which had ordained
4369       To place them ministers of the fifth moat,
4370       The power of thence departing took from all.
4371     
4372     A painted people there below we found,
4373       Who went about with footsteps very slow,
4374       Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.
4375     
4376     They had on mantles with the hoods low down
4377       Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut
4378       That in Cologne they for the monks are made.
4379     
4380     Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;
4381       But inwardly all leaden and so heavy
4382       That Frederick used to put them on of straw.
4383     
4384     O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!
4385       Again we turned us, still to the left hand
4386       Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;
4387     
4388     But owing to the weight, that weary folk
4389       Came on so tardily, that we were new
4390       In company at each motion of the haunch.
4391     
4392     Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find
4393       Some one who may by deed or name be known,
4394       And thus in going move thine eye about."
4395     
4396     And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,
4397       Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,
4398       Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!
4399     
4400     Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."
4401       Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,
4402       And then according to his pace proceed."
4403     
4404     I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste
4405       Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;
4406       But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.
4407     
4408     When they came up, long with an eye askance
4409       They scanned me without uttering a word.
4410       Then to each other turned, and said together:
4411     
4412     "He by the action of his throat seems living;
4413       And if they dead are, by what privilege
4414       Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"
4415     
4416     Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college
4417       Of miserable hypocrites art come,
4418       Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."
4419     
4420     And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up
4421       In the great town on the fair river of Arno,
4422       And with the body am I've always had.
4423     
4424     But who are ye, in whom there trickles down
4425       Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?
4426       And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"
4427     
4428     And one replied to me: "These orange cloaks
4429       Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights
4430       Cause in this way their balances to creak.
4431     
4432     Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;
4433       I Catalano, and he Loderingo
4434       Named, and together taken by thy city,
4435     
4436     As the wont is to take one man alone,
4437       For maintenance of its peace; and we were such
4438       That still it is apparent round Gardingo."
4439     
4440     "O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."
4441       But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed
4442       One crucified with three stakes on the ground.
4443     
4444     When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,
4445       Blowing into his beard with suspirations;
4446       And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,
4447     
4448     Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,
4449       Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet
4450       To put one man to torture for the people.
4451     
4452     Crosswise and naked is he on the path,
4453       As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,
4454       Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;
4455     
4456     And in like mode his father-in-law is punished
4457       Within this moat, and the others of the council,
4458       Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."
4459     
4460     And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel
4461       O'er him who was extended on the cross
4462       So vilely in eternal banishment.
4463     
4464     Then he directed to the Friar this voice:
4465       "Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us
4466       If to the right hand any pass slope down
4467     
4468     By which we two may issue forth from here,
4469       Without constraining some of the black angels
4470       To come and extricate us from this deep."
4471     
4472     Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest
4473       There is a rock, that forth from the great circle
4474       Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,
4475     
4476     Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;
4477       You will be able to mount up the ruin,
4478       That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."
4479     
4480     The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;
4481       Then said: "The business badly he recounted
4482       Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."
4483     
4484     And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices
4485       Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,
4486       That he's a liar and the father of lies."
4487     
4488     Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,
4489       Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;
4490       Whence from the heavy-laden I departed
4491     
4492     After the prints of his beloved feet.
4493     
4494     
4495     
4496     Inferno: Canto XXIV
4497     
4498     
4499     In that part of the youthful year wherein
4500       The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,
4501       And now the nights draw near to half the day,
4502     
4503     What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground
4504       The outward semblance of her sister white,
4505       But little lasts the temper of her pen,
4506     
4507     The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,
4508       Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign
4509       All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,
4510     
4511     Returns in doors, and up and down laments,
4512       Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;
4513       Then he returns and hope revives again,
4514     
4515     Seeing the world has changed its countenance
4516       In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,
4517       And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.
4518     
4519     Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,
4520       When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,
4521       And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.
4522     
4523     For as we came unto the ruined bridge,
4524       The Leader turned to me with that sweet look
4525       Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.
4526     
4527     His arms he opened, after some advisement
4528       Within himself elected, looking first
4529       Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.
4530     
4531     And even as he who acts and meditates,
4532       For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,
4533       So upward lifting me towards the summit
4534     
4535     Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,
4536       Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,
4537       But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."
4538     
4539     This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;
4540       For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,
4541       Were able to ascend from jag to jag.
4542     
4543     And had it not been, that upon that precinct
4544       Shorter was the ascent than on the other,
4545       He I know not, but I had been dead beat.
4546     
4547     But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth
4548       Of the profoundest well is all inclining,
4549       The structure of each valley doth import
4550     
4551     That one bank rises and the other sinks.
4552       Still we arrived at length upon the point
4553       Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.
4554     
4555     The breath was from my lungs so milked away,
4556       When I was up, that I could go no farther,
4557       Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.
4558     
4559     "Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"
4560       My Master said; "for sitting upon down,
4561       Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,
4562     
4563     Withouten which whoso his life consumes
4564       Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,
4565       As smoke in air or in the water foam.
4566     
4567     And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish
4568       With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,
4569       If with its heavy body it sink not.
4570     
4571     A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;
4572       'Tis not enough from these to have departed;
4573       Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."
4574     
4575     Then I uprose, showing myself provided
4576       Better with breath than I did feel myself,
4577       And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."
4578     
4579     Upward we took our way along the crag,
4580       Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,
4581       And more precipitous far than that before.
4582     
4583     Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;
4584       Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,
4585       Not well adapted to articulate words.
4586     
4587     I know not what it said, though o'er the back
4588       I now was of the arch that passes there;
4589       But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.
4590     
4591     I was bent downward, but my living eyes
4592       Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;
4593       Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive
4594     
4595     At the next round, and let us descend the wall;
4596       For as from hence I hear and understand not,
4597       So I look down and nothing I distinguish."
4598     
4599     "Other response," he said, "I make thee not,
4600       Except the doing; for the modest asking
4601       Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."
4602     
4603     We from the bridge descended at its head,
4604       Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,
4605       And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;
4606     
4607     And I beheld therein a terrible throng
4608       Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,
4609       That the remembrance still congeals my blood
4610     
4611     Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;
4612       For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae
4613       She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,
4614     
4615     Neither so many plagues nor so malignant
4616       E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,
4617       Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!
4618     
4619     Among this cruel and most dismal throng
4620       People were running naked and affrighted.
4621       Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.
4622     
4623     They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;
4624       These riveted upon their reins the tail
4625       And head, and were in front of them entwined.
4626     
4627     And lo! at one who was upon our side
4628       There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him
4629       There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.
4630     
4631     Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,
4632       As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly
4633       Behoved it that in falling he became.
4634     
4635     And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,
4636       The ashes drew together, and of themselves
4637       Into himself they instantly returned.
4638     
4639     Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed
4640       The phoenix dies, and then is born again,
4641       When it approaches its five-hundredth year;
4642     
4643     On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
4644       But only on tears of incense and amomum,
4645       And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.
4646     
4647     And as he is who falls, and knows not how,
4648       By force of demons who to earth down drag him,
4649       Or other oppilation that binds man,
4650     
4651     When he arises and around him looks,
4652       Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish
4653       Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;
4654     
4655     Such was that sinner after he had risen.
4656       Justice of God! O how severe it is,
4657       That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!
4658     
4659     The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;
4660       Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany
4661       A short time since into this cruel gorge.
4662     
4663     A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,
4664       Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,
4665       Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den."
4666     
4667     And I unto the Guide: "Tell him to stir not,
4668       And ask what crime has thrust him here below,
4669       For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him."
4670     
4671     And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,
4672       But unto me directed mind and face,
4673       And with a melancholy shame was painted.
4674     
4675     Then said: "It pains me more that thou hast caught me
4676       Amid this misery where thou seest me,
4677       Than when I from the other life was taken.
4678     
4679     What thou demandest I cannot deny;
4680       So low am I put down because I robbed
4681       The sacristy of the fair ornaments,
4682     
4683     And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;
4684       But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,
4685       If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,
4686     
4687     Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:
4688       Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;
4689       Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;
4690     
4691     Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,
4692       Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,
4693       And with impetuous and bitter tempest
4694     
4695     Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;
4696       When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,
4697       So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.
4698     
4699     And this I've said that it may give thee pain."
4700     
4701     
4702     
4703     Inferno: Canto XXV
4704     
4705     
4706     At the conclusion of his words, the thief
4707       Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,
4708       Crying: "Take that, God, for at thee I aim them."
4709     
4710     From that time forth the serpents were my friends;
4711       For one entwined itself about his neck
4712       As if it said: "I will not thou speak more;"
4713     
4714     And round his arms another, and rebound him,
4715       Clinching itself together so in front,
4716       That with them he could not a motion make.
4717     
4718     Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not
4719       To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,
4720       Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?
4721     
4722     Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,
4723       Spirit I saw not against God so proud,
4724       Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!
4725     
4726     He fled away, and spake no further word;
4727       And I beheld a Centaur full of rage
4728       Come crying out: "Where is, where is the scoffer?"
4729     
4730     I do not think Maremma has so many
4731       Serpents as he had all along his back,
4732       As far as where our countenance begins.
4733     
4734     Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,
4735       With wings wide open was a dragon lying,
4736       And he sets fire to all that he encounters.
4737     
4738     My Master said: "That one is Cacus, who
4739       Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine
4740       Created oftentimes a lake of blood.
4741     
4742     He goes not on the same road with his brothers,
4743       By reason of the fraudulent theft he made
4744       Of the great herd, which he had near to him;
4745     
4746     Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath
4747       The mace of Hercules, who peradventure
4748       Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."
4749     
4750     While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,
4751       And spirits three had underneath us come,
4752       Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,
4753     
4754     Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"
4755       On which account our story made a halt,
4756       And then we were intent on them alone.
4757     
4758     I did not know them; but it came to pass,
4759       As it is wont to happen by some chance,
4760       That one to name the other was compelled,
4761     
4762     Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"
4763       Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,
4764       Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.
4765     
4766     If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe
4767       What I shall say, it will no marvel be,
4768       For I who saw it hardly can admit it.
4769     
4770     As I was holding raised on them my brows,
4771       Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth
4772       In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.
4773     
4774     With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,
4775       And with the forward ones his arms it seized;
4776       Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;
4777     
4778     The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,
4779       And put its tail through in between the two,
4780       And up behind along the reins outspread it.
4781     
4782     Ivy was never fastened by its barbs
4783       Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile
4784       Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.
4785     
4786     Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax
4787       They had been made, and intermixed their colour;
4788       Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;
4789     
4790     E'en as proceedeth on before the flame
4791       Upward along the paper a brown colour,
4792       Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.
4793     
4794     The other two looked on, and each of them
4795       Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!
4796       Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."
4797     
4798     Already the two heads had one become,
4799       When there appeared to us two figures mingled
4800       Into one face, wherein the two were lost.
4801     
4802     Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,
4803       The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest
4804       Members became that never yet were seen.
4805     
4806     Every original aspect there was cancelled;
4807       Two and yet none did the perverted image
4808       Appear, and such departed with slow pace.
4809     
4810     Even as a lizard, under the great scourge
4811       Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,
4812       Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;
4813     
4814     Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies
4815       Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,
4816       Livid and black as is a peppercorn.
4817     
4818     And in that part whereat is first received
4819       Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;
4820       Then downward fell in front of him extended.
4821     
4822     The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;
4823       Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,
4824       Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.
4825     
4826     He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;
4827       One through the wound, the other through the mouth
4828       Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.
4829     
4830     Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions
4831       Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,
4832       And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.
4833     
4834     Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;
4835       For if him to a snake, her to fountain,
4836       Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;
4837     
4838     Because two natures never front to front
4839       Has he transmuted, so that both the forms
4840       To interchange their matter ready were.
4841     
4842     Together they responded in such wise,
4843       That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,
4844       And eke the wounded drew his feet together.
4845     
4846     The legs together with the thighs themselves
4847       Adhered so, that in little time the juncture
4848       No sign whatever made that was apparent.
4849     
4850     He with the cloven tail assumed the figure
4851       The other one was losing, and his skin
4852       Became elastic, and the other's hard.
4853     
4854     I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,
4855       And both feet of the reptile, that were short,
4856       Lengthen as much as those contracted were.
4857     
4858     Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,
4859       Became the member that a man conceals,
4860       And of his own the wretch had two created.
4861     
4862     While both of them the exhalation veils
4863       With a new colour, and engenders hair
4864       On one of them and depilates the other,
4865     
4866     The one uprose and down the other fell,
4867       Though turning not away their impious lamps,
4868       Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.
4869     
4870     He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,
4871       And from excess of matter, which came thither,
4872       Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;
4873     
4874     What did not backward run and was retained
4875       Of that excess made to the face a nose,
4876       And the lips thickened far as was befitting.
4877     
4878     He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,
4879       And backward draws the ears into his head,
4880       In the same manner as the snail its horns;
4881     
4882     And so the tongue, which was entire and apt
4883       For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked
4884       In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.
4885     
4886     The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,
4887       Along the valley hissing takes to flight,
4888       And after him the other speaking sputters.
4889     
4890     Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,
4891       And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,
4892       Crawling as I have done, along this road."
4893     
4894     In this way I beheld the seventh ballast
4895       Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse
4896       The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.
4897     
4898     And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be
4899       Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,
4900       They could not flee away so secretly
4901     
4902     But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;
4903       And he it was who sole of three companions,
4904       Which came in the beginning, was not changed;
4905     
4906     The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.
4907     
4908     
4909     
4910     Inferno: Canto XXVI
4911     
4912     
4913     Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,
4914       That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,
4915       And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!
4916     
4917     Among the thieves five citizens of thine
4918       Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,
4919       And thou thereby to no great honour risest.
4920     
4921     But if when morn is near our dreams are true,
4922       Feel shalt thou in a little time from now
4923       What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.
4924     
4925     And if it now were, it were not too soon;
4926       Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,
4927       For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.
4928     
4929     We went our way, and up along the stairs
4930       The bourns had made us to descend before,
4931       Remounted my Conductor and drew me.
4932     
4933     And following the solitary path
4934       Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,
4935       The foot without the hand sped not at all.
4936     
4937     Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,
4938       When I direct my mind to what I saw,
4939       And more my genius curb than I am wont,
4940     
4941     That it may run not unless virtue guide it;
4942       So that if some good star, or better thing,
4943       Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.
4944     
4945     As many as the hind (who on the hill
4946       Rests at the time when he who lights the world
4947       His countenance keeps least concealed from us,
4948     
4949     While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)
4950       Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,
4951       Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;
4952     
4953     With flames as manifold resplendent all
4954       Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware
4955       As soon as I was where the depth appeared.
4956     
4957     And such as he who with the bears avenged him
4958       Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,
4959       What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,
4960     
4961     For with his eye he could not follow it
4962       So as to see aught else than flame alone,
4963       Even as a little cloud ascending upward,
4964     
4965     Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment
4966       Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,
4967       And every flame a sinner steals away.
4968     
4969     I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,
4970       So that, if I had seized not on a rock,
4971       Down had I fallen without being pushed.
4972     
4973     And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,
4974       Exclaimed: "Within the fires the spirits are;
4975       Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns."
4976     
4977     "My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee
4978       I am more sure; but I surmised already
4979       It might be so, and already wished to ask thee
4980     
4981     Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft
4982       At top, it seems uprising from the pyre
4983       Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."
4984     
4985     He answered me: "Within there are tormented
4986       Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together
4987       They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.
4988     
4989     And there within their flame do they lament
4990       The ambush of the horse, which made the door
4991       Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;
4992     
4993     Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead
4994       Deidamia still deplores Achilles,
4995       And pain for the Palladium there is borne."
4996     
4997     "If they within those sparks possess the power
4998       To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,
4999       And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,
5000     
5001     That thou make no denial of awaiting
5002       Until the horned flame shall hither come;
5003       Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."
5004     
5005     And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty
5006       Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;
5007       But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.
5008     
5009     Leave me to speak, because I have conceived
5010       That which thou wishest; for they might disdain
5011       Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."
5012     
5013     When now the flame had come unto that point,
5014       Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,
5015       After this fashion did I hear him speak:
5016     
5017     "O ye, who are twofold within one fire,
5018       If I deserved of you, while I was living,
5019       If I deserved of you or much or little
5020     
5021     When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,
5022       Do not move on, but one of you declare
5023       Whither, being lost, he went away to die."
5024     
5025     Then of the antique flame the greater horn,
5026       Murmuring, began to wave itself about
5027       Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.
5028     
5029     Thereafterward, the summit to and fro
5030       Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,
5031       It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I
5032     
5033     From Circe had departed, who concealed me
5034       More than a year there near unto Gaeta,
5035       Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,
5036     
5037     Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
5038       For my old father, nor the due affection
5039       Which joyous should have made Penelope,
5040     
5041     Could overcome within me the desire
5042       I had to be experienced of the world,
5043       And of the vice and virtue of mankind;
5044     
5045     But I put forth on the high open sea
5046       With one sole ship, and that small company
5047       By which I never had deserted been.
5048     
5049     Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,
5050       Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,
5051       And the others which that sea bathes round about.
5052     
5053     I and my company were old and slow
5054       When at that narrow passage we arrived
5055       Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,
5056     
5057     That man no farther onward should adventure.
5058       On the right hand behind me left I Seville,
5059       And on the other already had left Ceuta.
5060     
5061     'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand
5062       Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,
5063       To this so inconsiderable vigil
5064     
5065     Which is remaining of your senses still
5066       Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,
5067       Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.
5068     
5069     Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;
5070       Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,
5071       But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'
5072     
5073     So eager did I render my companions,
5074       With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,
5075       That then I hardly could have held them back.
5076     
5077     And having turned our stern unto the morning,
5078       We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
5079       Evermore gaining on the larboard side.
5080     
5081     Already all the stars of the other pole
5082       The night beheld, and ours so very low
5083       It did not rise above the ocean floor.
5084     
5085     Five times rekindled and as many quenched
5086       Had been the splendour underneath the moon,
5087       Since we had entered into the deep pass,
5088     
5089     When there appeared to us a mountain, dim
5090       From distance, and it seemed to me so high
5091       As I had never any one beheld.
5092     
5093     Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;
5094       For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,
5095       And smote upon the fore part of the ship.
5096     
5097     Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,
5098       At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,
5099       And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,
5100     
5101     Until the sea above us closed again."
5102     
5103     
5104     
5105     Inferno: Canto XXVII
5106     
5107     
5108     Already was the flame erect and quiet,
5109       To speak no more, and now departed from us
5110       With the permission of the gentle Poet;
5111     
5112     When yet another, which behind it came,
5113       Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top
5114       By a confused sound that issued from it.
5115     
5116     As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first
5117       With the lament of him, and that was right,
5118       Who with his file had modulated it)
5119     
5120     Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,
5121       That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,
5122       Still it appeared with agony transfixed;
5123     
5124     Thus, by not having any way or issue
5125       At first from out the fire, to its own language
5126       Converted were the melancholy words.
5127     
5128     But afterwards, when they had gathered way
5129       Up through the point, giving it that vibration
5130       The tongue had given them in their passage out,
5131     
5132     We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim
5133       My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,
5134       Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'
5135     
5136     Because I come perchance a little late,
5137       To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;
5138       Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.
5139     
5140     If thou but lately into this blind world
5141       Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,
5142       Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,
5143     
5144     Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,
5145       For I was from the mountains there between
5146       Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."
5147     
5148     I still was downward bent and listening,
5149       When my Conductor touched me on the side,
5150       Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."
5151     
5152     And I, who had beforehand my reply
5153       In readiness, forthwith began to speak:
5154       "O soul, that down below there art concealed,
5155     
5156     Romagna thine is not and never has been
5157       Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;
5158       But open war I none have left there now.
5159     
5160     Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;
5161       The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,
5162       So that she covers Cervia with her vans.
5163     
5164     The city which once made the long resistance,
5165       And of the French a sanguinary heap,
5166       Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;
5167     
5168     Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,
5169       Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,
5170       Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.
5171     
5172     The cities of Lamone and Santerno
5173       Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,
5174       Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;
5175     
5176     And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,
5177       Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,
5178       Lives between tyranny and a free state.
5179     
5180     Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;
5181       Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,
5182       So may thy name hold front there in the world."
5183     
5184     After the fire a little more had roared
5185       In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved
5186       This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:
5187     
5188     "If I believed that my reply were made
5189       To one who to the world would e'er return,
5190       This flame without more flickering would stand still;
5191     
5192     But inasmuch as never from this depth
5193       Did any one return, if I hear true,
5194       Without the fear of infamy I answer,
5195     
5196     I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,
5197       Believing thus begirt to make amends;
5198       And truly my belief had been fulfilled
5199     
5200     But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,
5201       Who put me back into my former sins;
5202       And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.
5203     
5204     While I was still the form of bone and pulp
5205       My mother gave to me, the deeds I did
5206       Were not those of a lion, but a fox.
5207     
5208     The machinations and the covert ways
5209       I knew them all, and practised so their craft,
5210       That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.
5211     
5212     When now unto that portion of mine age
5213       I saw myself arrived, when each one ought
5214       To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,
5215     
5216     That which before had pleased me then displeased me;
5217       And penitent and confessing I surrendered,
5218       Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;
5219     
5220     The Leader of the modern Pharisees
5221       Having a war near unto Lateran,
5222       And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,
5223     
5224     For each one of his enemies was Christian,
5225       And none of them had been to conquer Acre,
5226       Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,
5227     
5228     Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,
5229       In him regarded, nor in me that cord
5230       Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;
5231     
5232     But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester
5233       To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,
5234       So this one sought me out as an adept
5235     
5236     To cure him of the fever of his pride.
5237       Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,
5238       Because his words appeared inebriate.
5239     
5240     And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;
5241       Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me
5242       How to raze Palestrina to the ground.
5243     
5244     Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,
5245       As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,
5246       The which my predecessor held not dear.'
5247     
5248     Then urged me on his weighty arguments
5249       There, where my silence was the worst advice;
5250       And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me
5251     
5252     Of that sin into which I now must fall,
5253       The promise long with the fulfilment short
5254       Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'
5255     
5256     Francis came afterward, when I was dead,
5257       For me; but one of the black Cherubim
5258       Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;
5259     
5260     He must come down among my servitors,
5261       Because he gave the fraudulent advice
5262       From which time forth I have been at his hair;
5263     
5264     For who repents not cannot be absolved,
5265       Nor can one both repent and will at once,
5266       Because of the contradiction which consents not.'
5267     
5268     O miserable me! how I did shudder
5269       When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure
5270       Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'
5271     
5272     He bore me unto Minos, who entwined
5273       Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,
5274       And after he had bitten it in great rage,
5275     
5276     Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'
5277       Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,
5278       And vested thus in going I bemoan me."
5279     
5280     When it had thus completed its recital,
5281       The flame departed uttering lamentations,
5282       Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.
5283     
5284     Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,
5285       Up o'er the crag above another arch,
5286       Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee
5287     
5288     By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.
5289     
5290     
5291     
5292     Inferno: Canto XXVIII
5293     
5294     
5295     Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words,
5296       Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full
5297       Which now I saw, by many times narrating?
5298     
5299     Each tongue would for a certainty fall short
5300       By reason of our speech and memory,
5301       That have small room to comprehend so much.
5302     
5303     If were again assembled all the people
5304       Which formerly upon the fateful land
5305       Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood
5306     
5307     Shed by the Romans and the lingering war
5308       That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,
5309       As Livy has recorded, who errs not,
5310     
5311     With those who felt the agony of blows
5312       By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,
5313       And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still
5314     
5315     At Ceperano, where a renegade
5316       Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,
5317       Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,
5318     
5319     And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,
5320       Should show, it would be nothing to compare
5321       With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.
5322     
5323     A cask by losing centre-piece or cant
5324       Was never shattered so, as I saw one
5325       Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.
5326     
5327     Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;
5328       His heart was visible, and the dismal sack
5329       That maketh excrement of what is eaten.
5330     
5331     While I was all absorbed in seeing him,
5332       He looked at me, and opened with his hands
5333       His bosom, saying: "See now how I rend me;
5334     
5335     How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;
5336       In front of me doth Ali weeping go,
5337       Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;
5338     
5339     And all the others whom thou here beholdest,
5340       Disseminators of scandal and of schism
5341       While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.
5342     
5343     A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us
5344       Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge
5345       Putting again each one of all this ream,
5346     
5347     When we have gone around the doleful road;
5348       By reason that our wounds are closed again
5349       Ere any one in front of him repass.
5350     
5351     But who art thou, that musest on the crag,
5352       Perchance to postpone going to the pain
5353       That is adjudged upon thine accusations?"
5354     
5355     "Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,"
5356       My Master made reply, "to be tormented;
5357       But to procure him full experience,
5358     
5359     Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him
5360       Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;
5361       And this is true as that I speak to thee."
5362     
5363     More than a hundred were there when they heard him,
5364       Who in the moat stood still to look at me,
5365       Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.
5366     
5367     "Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,
5368       Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,
5369       If soon he wish not here to follow me,
5370     
5371     So with provisions, that no stress of snow
5372       May give the victory to the Novarese,
5373       Which otherwise to gain would not be easy."
5374     
5375     After one foot to go away he lifted,
5376       This word did Mahomet say unto me,
5377       Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.
5378     
5379     Another one, who had his throat pierced through,
5380       And nose cut off close underneath the brows,
5381       And had no longer but a single ear,
5382     
5383     Staying to look in wonder with the others,
5384       Before the others did his gullet open,
5385       Which outwardly was red in every part,
5386     
5387     And said: "O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,
5388       And whom I once saw up in Latian land,
5389       Unless too great similitude deceive me,
5390     
5391     Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,
5392       If e'er thou see again the lovely plain
5393       That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,
5394     
5395     And make it known to the best two of Fano,
5396       To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,
5397       That if foreseeing here be not in vain,
5398     
5399     Cast over from their vessel shall they be,
5400       And drowned near unto the Cattolica,
5401       By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.
5402     
5403     Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca
5404       Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime,
5405       Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.
5406     
5407     That traitor, who sees only with one eye,
5408       And holds the land, which some one here with me
5409       Would fain be fasting from the vision of,
5410     
5411     Will make them come unto a parley with him;
5412       Then will do so, that to Focara's wind
5413       They will not stand in need of vow or prayer."
5414     
5415     And I to him: "Show to me and declare,
5416       If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,
5417       Who is this person of the bitter vision."
5418     
5419     Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw
5420       Of one of his companions, and his mouth
5421       Oped, crying: "This is he, and he speaks not.
5422     
5423     This one, being banished, every doubt submerged
5424       In Caesar by affirming the forearmed
5425       Always with detriment allowed delay."
5426     
5427     O how bewildered unto me appeared,
5428       With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,
5429       Curio, who in speaking was so bold!
5430     
5431     And one, who both his hands dissevered had,
5432       The stumps uplifting through the murky air,
5433       So that the blood made horrible his face,
5434     
5435     Cried out: "Thou shalt remember Mosca also,
5436       Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!'
5437       Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people."
5438     
5439     "And death unto thy race," thereto I added;
5440       Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,
5441       Departed, like a person sad and crazed.
5442     
5443     But I remained to look upon the crowd;
5444       And saw a thing which I should be afraid,
5445       Without some further proof, even to recount,
5446     
5447     If it were not that conscience reassures me,
5448       That good companion which emboldens man
5449       Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.
5450     
5451     I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,
5452       A trunk without a head walk in like manner
5453       As walked the others of the mournful herd.
5454     
5455     And by the hair it held the head dissevered,
5456       Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,
5457       And that upon us gazed and said: "O me!"
5458     
5459     It of itself made to itself a lamp,
5460       And they were two in one, and one in two;
5461       How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.
5462     
5463     When it was come close to the bridge's foot,
5464       It lifted high its arm with all the head,
5465       To bring more closely unto us its words,
5466     
5467     Which were: "Behold now the sore penalty,
5468       Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;
5469       Behold if any be as great as this.
5470     
5471     And so that thou may carry news of me,
5472       Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same
5473       Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.
5474     
5475     I made the father and the son rebellious;
5476       Achitophel not more with Absalom
5477       And David did with his accursed goadings.
5478     
5479     Because I parted persons so united,
5480       Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!
5481       From its beginning, which is in this trunk.
5482     
5483     Thus is observed in me the counterpoise."

5486     
5487     Inferno: Canto XXIX
5488     
5489     
5490     The many people and the divers wounds
5491       These eyes of mine had so inebriated,
5492       That they were wishful to stand still and weep;
5493     
5494     But said Virgilius: "What dost thou still gaze at?
5495       Why is thy sight still riveted down there
5496       Among the mournful, mutilated shades?
5497     
5498     Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;
5499       Consider, if to count them thou believest,
5500       That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,
5501     
5502     And now the moon is underneath our feet;
5503       Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,
5504       And more is to be seen than what thou seest."
5505     
5506     "If thou hadst," I made answer thereupon,
5507       "Attended to the cause for which I looked,
5508       Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned."
5509     
5510     Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him
5511       I went, already making my reply,
5512       And superadding: "In that cavern where
5513     
5514     I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,
5515       I think a spirit of my blood laments
5516       The sin which down below there costs so much."
5517     
5518     Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken
5519       Thy thought from this time forward upon him;
5520       Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;
5521     
5522     For him I saw below the little bridge,
5523       Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger
5524       Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.
5525     
5526     So wholly at that time wast thou impeded
5527       By him who formerly held Altaforte,
5528       Thou didst not look that way; so he departed."
5529     
5530     "O my Conductor, his own violent death,
5531       Which is not yet avenged for him," I said,
5532       "By any who is sharer in the shame,
5533     
5534     Made him disdainful; whence he went away,
5535       As I imagine, without speaking to me,
5536       And thereby made me pity him the more."
5537     
5538     Thus did we speak as far as the first place
5539       Upon the crag, which the next valley shows
5540       Down to the bottom, if there were more light.
5541     
5542     When we were now right over the last cloister
5543       Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers
5544       Could manifest themselves unto our sight,
5545     
5546     Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,
5547       Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,
5548       Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.
5549     
5550     What pain would be, if from the hospitals
5551       Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September,
5552       And of Maremma and Sardinia
5553     
5554     All the diseases in one moat were gathered,
5555       Such was it here, and such a stench came from it
5556       As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.
5557     
5558     We had descended on the furthest bank
5559       From the long crag, upon the left hand still,
5560       And then more vivid was my power of sight
5561     
5562     Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress
5563       Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,
5564       Punishes forgers, which she here records.
5565     
5566     I do not think a sadder sight to see
5567       Was in Aegina the whole people sick,
5568       (When was the air so full of pestilence,
5569     
5570     The animals, down to the little worm,
5571       All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,
5572       According as the poets have affirmed,
5573     
5574     Were from the seed of ants restored again,)
5575       Than was it to behold through that dark valley
5576       The spirits languishing in divers heaps.
5577     
5578     This on the belly, that upon the back
5579       One of the other lay, and others crawling
5580       Shifted themselves along the dismal road.
5581     
5582     We step by step went onward without speech,
5583       Gazing upon and listening to the sick
5584       Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.
5585     
5586     I saw two sitting leaned against each other,
5587       As leans in heating platter against platter,
5588       From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;
5589     
5590     And never saw I plied a currycomb
5591       By stable-boy for whom his master waits,
5592       Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,
5593     
5594     As every one was plying fast the bite
5595       Of nails upon himself, for the great rage
5596       Of itching which no other succour had.
5597     
5598     And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,
5599       In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,
5600       Or any other fish that has them largest.
5601     
5602     "O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"
5603       Began my Leader unto one of them,
5604       "And makest of them pincers now and then,
5605     
5606     Tell me if any Latian is with those
5607       Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee
5608       To all eternity unto this work."
5609     
5610     "Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,
5611       Both of us here," one weeping made reply;
5612       "But who art thou, that questionest about us?"
5613     
5614     And said the Guide: "One am I who descends
5615       Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,
5616       And I intend to show Hell unto him."
5617     
5618     Then broken was their mutual support,
5619       And trembling each one turned himself to me,
5620       With others who had heard him by rebound.
5621     
5622     Wholly to me did the good Master gather,
5623       Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."
5624       And I began, since he would have it so:
5625     
5626     "So may your memory not steal away
5627       In the first world from out the minds of men,
5628       But so may it survive 'neath many suns,
5629     
5630     Say to me who ye are, and of what people;
5631       Let not your foul and loathsome punishment
5632       Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."
5633     
5634     "I of Arezzo was," one made reply,
5635       "And Albert of Siena had me burned;
5636       But what I died for does not bring me here.
5637     
5638     'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,
5639       That I could rise by flight into the air,
5640       And he who had conceit, but little wit,
5641     
5642     Would have me show to him the art; and only
5643       Because no Daedalus I made him, made me
5644       Be burned by one who held him as his son.
5645     
5646     But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,
5647       For alchemy, which in the world I practised,
5648       Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned."
5649     
5650     And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever
5651       So vain a people as the Sienese?
5652       Not for a certainty the French by far."
5653     
5654     Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,
5655       Replied unto my speech: "Taking out Stricca,
5656       Who knew the art of moderate expenses,
5657     
5658     And Niccolo, who the luxurious use
5659       Of cloves discovered earliest of all
5660       Within that garden where such seed takes root;
5661     
5662     And taking out the band, among whom squandered
5663       Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,
5664       And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!
5665     
5666     But, that thou know who thus doth second thee
5667       Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
5668       Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,
5669     
5670     And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,
5671       Who metals falsified by alchemy;
5672       Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,
5673     
5674     How I a skilful ape of nature was."
5675     
5676     
5677     
5678     Inferno: Canto XXX
5679     
5680     
5681     'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,
5682       For Semele, against the Theban blood,
5683       As she already more than once had shown,
5684     
5685     So reft of reason Athamas became,
5686       That, seeing his own wife with children twain
5687       Walking encumbered upon either hand,
5688     
5689     He cried: "Spread out the nets, that I may take
5690       The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;"
5691       And then extended his unpitying claws,
5692     
5693     Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,
5694       And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;
5695       And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--
5696     
5697     And at the time when fortune downward hurled
5698       The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,
5699       So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,
5700     
5701     Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,
5702       When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,
5703       And of her Polydorus on the shore
5704     
5705     Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,
5706       Out of her senses like a dog she barked,
5707       So much the anguish had her mind distorted;
5708     
5709     But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan
5710       Were ever seen in any one so cruel
5711       In goading beasts, and much more human members,
5712     
5713     As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,
5714       Who, biting, in the manner ran along
5715       That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.
5716     
5717     One to Capocchio came, and by the nape
5718       Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging
5719       It made his belly grate the solid bottom.
5720     
5721     And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,
5722       Said to me: "That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,
5723       And raving goes thus harrying other people."
5724     
5725     "O," said I to him, "so may not the other
5726       Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee
5727       To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence."
5728     
5729     And he to me: "That is the ancient ghost
5730       Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became
5731       Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.
5732     
5733     She came to sin with him after this manner,
5734       By counterfeiting of another's form;
5735       As he who goeth yonder undertook,
5736     
5737     That he might gain the lady of the herd,
5738       To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,
5739       Making a will and giving it due form."
5740     
5741     And after the two maniacs had passed
5742       On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back
5743       To look upon the other evil-born.
5744     
5745     I saw one made in fashion of a lute,
5746       If he had only had the groin cut off
5747       Just at the point at which a man is forked.
5748     
5749     The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions
5750       The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,
5751       That the face corresponds not to the belly,
5752     
5753     Compelled him so to hold his lips apart
5754       As does the hectic, who because of thirst
5755       One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.
5756     
5757     "O ye, who without any torment are,
5758       And why I know not, in the world of woe,"
5759       He said to us, "behold, and be attentive
5760     
5761     Unto the misery of Master Adam;
5762       I had while living much of what I wished,
5763       And now, alas! a drop of water crave.
5764     
5765     The rivulets, that from the verdant hills
5766       Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,
5767       Making their channels to be cold and moist,
5768     
5769     Ever before me stand, and not in vain;
5770       For far more doth their image dry me up
5771       Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.
5772     
5773     The rigid justice that chastises me
5774       Draweth occasion from the place in which
5775       I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.
5776     
5777     There is Romena, where I counterfeited
5778       The currency imprinted with the Baptist,
5779       For which I left my body burned above.
5780     
5781     But if I here could see the tristful soul
5782       Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,
5783       For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.
5784     
5785     One is within already, if the raving
5786       Shades that are going round about speak truth;
5787       But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?
5788     
5789     If I were only still so light, that in
5790       A hundred years I could advance one inch,
5791       I had already started on the way,
5792     
5793     Seeking him out among this squalid folk,
5794       Although the circuit be eleven miles,
5795       And be not less than half a mile across.
5796     
5797     For them am I in such a family;
5798       They did induce me into coining florins,
5799       Which had three carats of impurity."
5800     
5801     And I to him: "Who are the two poor wretches
5802       That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,
5803       Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?"
5804     
5805     "I found them here," replied he, "when I rained
5806       Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,
5807       Nor do I think they will for evermore.
5808     
5809     One the false woman is who accused Joseph,
5810       The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;
5811       From acute fever they send forth such reek."
5812     
5813     And one of them, who felt himself annoyed
5814       At being, peradventure, named so darkly,
5815       Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.
5816     
5817     It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;
5818       And Master Adam smote him in the face,
5819       With arm that did not seem to be less hard,
5820     
5821     Saying to him: "Although be taken from me
5822       All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,
5823       I have an arm unfettered for such need."
5824     
5825     Whereat he answer made: "When thou didst go
5826       Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:
5827       But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining."
5828     
5829     The dropsical: "Thou sayest true in that;
5830       But thou wast not so true a witness there,
5831       Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy."
5832     
5833     "If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,"
5834       Said Sinon; "and for one fault I am here,
5835       And thou for more than any other demon."
5836     
5837     "Remember, perjurer, about the horse,"
5838       He made reply who had the swollen belly,
5839       "And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it."
5840     
5841     "Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks
5842       Thy tongue," the Greek said, "and the putrid water
5843       That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes."
5844     
5845     Then the false-coiner: "So is gaping wide
5846       Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;
5847       Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me
5848     
5849     Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,
5850       And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus
5851       Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee."
5852     
5853     In listening to them was I wholly fixed,
5854       When said the Master to me: "Now just look,
5855       For little wants it that I quarrel with thee."
5856     
5857     When him I heard in anger speak to me,
5858       I turned me round towards him with such shame
5859       That still it eddies through my memory.
5860     
5861     And as he is who dreams of his own harm,
5862       Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,
5863       So that he craves what is, as if it were not;
5864     
5865     Such I became, not having power to speak,
5866       For to excuse myself I wished, and still
5867       Excused myself, and did not think I did it.
5868     
5869     "Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,"
5870       The Master said, "than this of thine has been;
5871       Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,
5872     
5873     And make account that I am aye beside thee,
5874       If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee
5875       Where there are people in a like dispute;
5876     
5877     For a base wish it is to wish to hear it."
5878     
5879     
5880     
5881     Inferno: Canto XXXI
5882     
5883     
5884     One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,
5885       So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,
5886       And then held out to me the medicine;
5887     
5888     Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,
5889       His and his father's, used to be the cause
5890       First of a sad and then a gracious boon.
5891     
5892     We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,
5893       Upon the bank that girds it round about,
5894       Going across it without any speech.
5895     
5896     There it was less than night, and less than day,
5897       So that my sight went little in advance;
5898       But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,
5899     
5900     So loud it would have made each thunder faint,
5901       Which, counter to it following its way,
5902       Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.
5903     
5904     After the dolorous discomfiture
5905       When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,
5906       So terribly Orlando sounded not.
5907     
5908     Short while my head turned thitherward I held
5909       When many lofty towers I seemed to see,
5910       Whereat I: "Master, say, what town is this?"
5911     
5912     And he to me: "Because thou peerest forth
5913       Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,
5914       It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.
5915     
5916     Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,
5917       How much the sense deceives itself by distance;
5918       Therefore a little faster spur thee on."
5919     
5920     Then tenderly he took me by the hand,
5921       And said: "Before we farther have advanced,
5922       That the reality may seem to thee
5923     
5924     Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,
5925       And they are in the well, around the bank,
5926       From navel downward, one and all of them."
5927     
5928     As, when the fog is vanishing away,
5929       Little by little doth the sight refigure
5930       Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,
5931     
5932     So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,
5933       More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,
5934       My error fled, and fear came over me;
5935     
5936     Because as on its circular parapets
5937       Montereggione crowns itself with towers,
5938       E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well
5939     
5940     With one half of their bodies turreted
5941       The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces
5942       E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.
5943     
5944     And I of one already saw the face,
5945       Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,
5946       And down along his sides both of the arms.
5947     
5948     Certainly Nature, when she left the making
5949       Of animals like these, did well indeed,
5950       By taking such executors from Mars;
5951     
5952     And if of elephants and whales she doth not
5953       Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly
5954       More just and more discreet will hold her for it;
5955     
5956     For where the argument of intellect
5957       Is added unto evil will and power,
5958       No rampart can the people make against it.
5959     
5960     His face appeared to me as long and large
5961       As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,
5962       And in proportion were the other bones;
5963     
5964     So that the margin, which an apron was
5965       Down from the middle, showed so much of him
5966       Above it, that to reach up to his hair
5967     
5968     Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;
5969       For I beheld thirty great palms of him
5970       Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.
5971     
5972     "Raphael mai amech izabi almi,"
5973       Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,
5974       To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.
5975     
5976     And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,
5977       Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,
5978       When wrath or other passion touches thee.
5979     
5980     Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt
5981       Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,
5982       And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."
5983     
5984     Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;
5985       This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought
5986       One language in the world is not still used.
5987     
5988     Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;
5989       For even such to him is every language
5990       As his to others, which to none is known."
5991     
5992     Therefore a longer journey did we make,
5993       Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft
5994       We found another far more fierce and large.
5995     
5996     In binding him, who might the master be
5997       I cannot say; but he had pinioned close
5998       Behind the right arm, and in front the other,
5999     
6000     With chains, that held him so begirt about
6001       From the neck down, that on the part uncovered
6002       It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.
6003     
6004     "This proud one wished to make experiment
6005       Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"
6006       My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.
6007     
6008     Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.
6009       What time the giants terrified the gods;
6010       The arms he wielded never more he moves."
6011     
6012     And I to him: "If possible, I should wish
6013       That of the measureless Briareus
6014       These eyes of mine might have experience."
6015     
6016     Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus
6017       Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,
6018       Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.
6019     
6020     Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,
6021       And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,
6022       Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."
6023     
6024     There never was an earthquake of such might
6025       That it could shake a tower so violently,
6026       As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.
6027     
6028     Then was I more afraid of death than ever,
6029       For nothing more was needful than the fear,
6030       If I had not beheld the manacles.
6031     
6032     Then we proceeded farther in advance,
6033       And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells
6034       Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.
6035     
6036     "O thou, who in the valley fortunate,
6037       Which Scipio the heir of glory made,
6038       When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,
6039     
6040     Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,
6041       And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war
6042       Among thy brothers, some it seems still think
6043     
6044     The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:
6045       Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,
6046       There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.
6047     
6048     Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;
6049       This one can give of that which here is longed for;
6050       Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.
6051     
6052     Still in the world can he restore thy fame;
6053       Because he lives, and still expects long life,
6054       If to itself Grace call him not untimely."
6055     
6056     So said the Master; and in haste the other
6057       His hands extended and took up my Guide,--
6058       Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.
6059     
6060     Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,
6061       Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"
6062       Then of himself and me one bundle made.
6063     
6064     As seems the Carisenda, to behold
6065       Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud
6066       Above it so that opposite it hangs;
6067     
6068     Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood
6069       Watching to see him stoop, and then it was
6070       I could have wished to go some other way.
6071     
6072     But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up
6073       Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;
6074       Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,
6075     
6076     But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.
6077     
6078     
6079     
6080     Inferno: Canto XXXII
6081     
6082     
6083     If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,
6084       As were appropriate to the dismal hole
6085       Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,
6086     
6087     I would press out the juice of my conception
6088       More fully; but because I have them not,
6089       Not without fear I bring myself to speak;
6090     
6091     For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,
6092       To sketch the bottom of all the universe,
6093       Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.
6094     
6095     But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,
6096       Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,
6097       That from the fact the word be not diverse.
6098     
6099     O rabble ill-begotten above all,
6100       Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,
6101       'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!
6102     
6103     When we were down within the darksome well,
6104       Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,
6105       And I was scanning still the lofty wall,
6106     
6107     I heard it said to me: "Look how thou steppest!
6108       Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
6109       The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!"
6110     
6111     Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me
6112       And underfoot a lake, that from the frost
6113       The semblance had of glass, and not of water.
6114     
6115     So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current
6116       In winter-time Danube in Austria,
6117       Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,
6118     
6119     As there was here; so that if Tambernich
6120       Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,
6121       E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.
6122     
6123     And as to croak the frog doth place himself
6124       With muzzle out of water,--when is dreaming
6125       Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,--
6126     
6127     Livid, as far down as where shame appears,
6128       Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,
6129       Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.
6130     
6131     Each one his countenance held downward bent;
6132       From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart
6133       Among them witness of itself procures.
6134     
6135     When round about me somewhat I had looked,
6136       I downward turned me, and saw two so close,
6137       The hair upon their heads together mingled.
6138     
6139     "Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"
6140       I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,
6141       And when to me their faces they had lifted,
6142     
6143     Their eyes, which first were only moist within,
6144       Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed
6145       The tears between, and locked them up again.
6146     
6147     Clamp never bound together wood with wood
6148       So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,
6149       Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.
6150     
6151     And one, who had by reason of the cold
6152       Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,
6153       Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?
6154     
6155     If thou desire to know who these two are,
6156       The valley whence Bisenzio descends
6157       Belonged to them and to their father Albert.
6158     
6159     They from one body came, and all Caina
6160       Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade
6161       More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;
6162     
6163     Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow
6164       At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;
6165       Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers
6166     
6167     So with his head I see no farther forward,
6168       And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;
6169       Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.
6170     
6171     And that thou put me not to further speech,
6172       Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,
6173       And wait Carlino to exonerate me."
6174     
6175     Then I beheld a thousand faces, made
6176       Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,
6177       And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.
6178     
6179     And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,
6180       Where everything of weight unites together,
6181       And I was shivering in the eternal shade,
6182     
6183     Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,
6184       I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads
6185       I struck my foot hard in the face of one.
6186     
6187     Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?
6188       Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
6189       of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"
6190     
6191     And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,
6192       That I through him may issue from a doubt;
6193       Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."
6194     
6195     The Leader stopped; and to that one I said
6196       Who was blaspheming vehemently still:
6197       "Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"
6198     
6199     "Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora
6200       Smiting," replied he, "other people's cheeks,
6201       So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?"
6202     
6203     "Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"
6204       Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,
6205       That 'mid the other notes thy name I place."
6206     
6207     And he to me: "For the reverse I long;
6208       Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;
6209       For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."
6210     
6211     Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,
6212       And said: "It must needs be thou name thyself,
6213       Or not a hair remain upon thee here."
6214     
6215     Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,
6216       I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,
6217       If on my head a thousand times thou fall."
6218     
6219     I had his hair in hand already twisted,
6220       And more than one shock of it had pulled out,
6221       He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,
6222     
6223     When cried another: "What doth ail thee, Bocca?
6224       Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,
6225       But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?"
6226     
6227     "Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,
6228       Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame
6229       I will report of thee veracious news."
6230     
6231     "Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,
6232       But be not silent, if thou issue hence,
6233       Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;
6234     
6235     He weepeth here the silver of the French;
6236       'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera
6237       There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'
6238     
6239     If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,
6240       Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,
6241       Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;
6242     
6243     Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be
6244       Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello
6245       Who oped Faenza when the people slep."
6246     
6247     Already we had gone away from him,
6248       When I beheld two frozen in one hole,
6249       So that one head a hood was to the other;
6250     
6251     And even as bread through hunger is devoured,
6252       The uppermost on the other set his teeth,
6253       There where the brain is to the nape united.
6254     
6255     Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed
6256       The temples of Menalippus in disdain,
6257       Than that one did the skull and the other things.
6258     
6259     "O thou, who showest by such bestial sign
6260       Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,
6261       Tell me the wherefore," said I, "with this compact,
6262     
6263     That if thou rightfully of him complain,
6264       In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,
6265       I in the world above repay thee for it,
6266     
6267     If that wherewith I speak be not dried up."

6270     
6271     Inferno: Canto XXXIII
6272     
6273     
6274     His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,
6275       That sinner, wiping it upon the hair
6276       Of the same head that he behind had wasted.
6277     
6278     Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew
6279       The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already
6280       To think of only, ere I speak of it;
6281     
6282     But if my words be seed that may bear fruit
6283       Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,
6284       Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.
6285     
6286     I know not who thou art, nor by what mode
6287       Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine
6288       Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.
6289     
6290     Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,
6291       And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;
6292       Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.
6293     
6294     That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,
6295       Trusting in him I was made prisoner,
6296       And after put to death, I need not say;
6297     
6298      But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,
6299       That is to say, how cruel was my death,
6300       Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.
6301     
6302     A narrow perforation in the mew,
6303       Which bears because of me the title of Famine,
6304       And in which others still must be locked up,
6305     
6306     Had shown me through its opening many moons
6307       Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
6308       Which of the future rent for me the veil.
6309     
6310     This one appeared to me as lord and master,
6311       Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
6312       For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.
6313     
6314     With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,
6315       Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi
6316       He had sent out before him to the front.
6317     
6318     After brief course seemed unto me forespent
6319       The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes
6320       It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.
6321     
6322     When I before the morrow was awake,
6323       Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons
6324       Who with me were, and asking after bread.
6325     
6326     Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,
6327       Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,
6328       And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?
6329     
6330     They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh
6331       At which our food used to be brought to us,
6332       And through his dream was each one apprehensive;
6333     
6334     And I heard locking up the under door
6335       Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word
6336       I gazed into the faces of my sons.
6337     
6338     I wept not, I within so turned to stone;
6339       They wept; and darling little Anselm mine
6340       Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'
6341     
6342     Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made
6343       All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,
6344       Until another sun rose on the world.
6345     
6346     As now a little glimmer made its way
6347       Into the dolorous prison, and I saw
6348       Upon four faces my own very aspect,
6349     
6350     Both of my hands in agony I bit;
6351       And, thinking that I did it from desire
6352       Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,
6353     
6354     And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us
6355       If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us
6356       With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'
6357     
6358     I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.
6359       That day we all were silent, and the next.
6360       Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?
6361     
6362     When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo
6363       Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,
6364       Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'
6365     
6366     And there he died; and, as thou seest me,
6367       I saw the three fall, one by one, between
6368       The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,
6369     
6370     Already blind, to groping over each,
6371       And three days called them after they were dead;
6372       Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."
6373     
6374     When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,
6375       The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,
6376       Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.
6377     
6378     Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people
6379       Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,
6380       Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,
6381     
6382     Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,
6383       And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno
6384       That every person in thee it may drown!
6385     
6386     For if Count Ugolino had the fame
6387       Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,
6388       Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.
6389     
6390     Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!
6391       Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,
6392       And the other two my song doth name above!
6393     
6394     We passed still farther onward, where the ice
6395       Another people ruggedly enswathes,
6396       Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.
6397     
6398     Weeping itself there does not let them weep,
6399       And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
6400       Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;
6401     
6402     Because the earliest tears a cluster form,
6403       And, in the manner of a crystal visor,
6404       Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.
6405     
6406     And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,
6407       Because of cold all sensibility
6408       Its station had abandoned in my face,
6409     
6410     Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;
6411       Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?
6412       Is not below here every vapour quenched?"
6413     
6414     Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where
6415       Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,
6416       Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."
6417     
6418     And one of the wretches of the frozen crust
6419       Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless
6420       That the last post is given unto you,
6421     
6422     Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I
6423       May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart
6424       A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."
6425     
6426     Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee
6427       Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,
6428       May I go to the bottom of the ice."
6429     
6430     Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;
6431       He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,
6432       Who here a date am getting for my fig."
6433     
6434     "O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"
6435       And he to me: "How may my body fare
6436       Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.
6437     
6438     Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,
6439       That oftentimes the soul descendeth here
6440       Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.
6441     
6442     And, that thou mayest more willingly remove
6443       From off my countenance these glassy tears,
6444       Know that as soon as any soul betrays
6445     
6446     As I have done, his body by a demon
6447       Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,
6448       Until his time has wholly been revolved.
6449     
6450     Itself down rushes into such a cistern;
6451       And still perchance above appears the body
6452       Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.
6453     
6454     This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;
6455       It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years
6456       Have passed away since he was thus locked up."
6457     
6458     "I think," said I to him, "thou dost deceive me;
6459       For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,
6460       And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes."
6461     
6462     "In moat above," said he, "of Malebranche,
6463       There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,
6464       As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,
6465     
6466     When this one left a devil in his stead
6467       In his own body and one near of kin,
6468       Who made together with him the betrayal.
6469     
6470     But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,
6471       Open mine eyes;"--and open them I did not,
6472       And to be rude to him was courtesy.
6473     
6474     Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance
6475       With every virtue, full of every vice
6476       Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?
6477     
6478     For with the vilest spirit of Romagna
6479       I found of you one such, who for his deeds
6480       In soul already in Cocytus bathes,
6481     
6482     And still above in body seems alive!
6483     
6484     
6485     
6486     Inferno: Canto XXXIV
6487     
6488     
6489     "'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni'
6490       Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,"
6491       My Master said, "if thou discernest him."
6492     
6493     As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when
6494       Our hemisphere is darkening into night,
6495       Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,
6496     
6497     Methought that such a building then I saw;
6498       And, for the wind, I drew myself behind
6499       My Guide, because there was no other shelter.
6500     
6501     Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,
6502       There where the shades were wholly covered up,
6503       And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.
6504     
6505     Some prone are lying, others stand erect,
6506       This with the head, and that one with the soles;
6507       Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.
6508     
6509     When in advance so far we had proceeded,
6510       That it my Master pleased to show to me
6511       The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,
6512     
6513     He from before me moved and made me stop,
6514       Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place
6515       Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."
6516     
6517     How frozen I became and powerless then,
6518       Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,
6519       Because all language would be insufficient.
6520     
6521     I did not die, and I alive remained not;
6522       Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,
6523       What I became, being of both deprived.
6524     
6525     The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous
6526       From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;
6527       And better with a giant I compare
6528     
6529     Than do the giants with those arms of his;
6530       Consider now how great must be that whole,
6531       Which unto such a part conforms itself.
6532     
6533     Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,
6534       And lifted up his brow against his Maker,
6535       Well may proceed from him all tribulation.
6536     
6537     O, what a marvel it appeared to me,
6538       When I beheld three faces on his head!
6539       The one in front, and that vermilion was;
6540     
6541     Two were the others, that were joined with this
6542       Above the middle part of either shoulder,
6543       And they were joined together at the crest;
6544     
6545     And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;
6546       The left was such to look upon as those
6547       Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.
6548     
6549     Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,
6550       Such as befitting were so great a bird;
6551       Sails of the sea I never saw so large.
6552     
6553      No feathers had they, but as of a bat
6554       Their fashion was; and he was waving them,
6555       So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.
6556     
6557     Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.
6558       With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins
6559       Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.
6560     
6561     At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
6562       A sinner, in the manner of a brake,
6563       So that he three of them tormented thus.
6564     
6565     To him in front the biting was as naught
6566       Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine
6567       Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.
6568     
6569     "That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"
6570       The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;
6571       With head inside, he plies his legs without.
6572     
6573     Of the two others, who head downward are,
6574       The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;
6575       See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.
6576     
6577     And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.
6578       But night is reascending, and 'tis time
6579       That we depart, for we have seen the whole."
6580     
6581     As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,
6582       And he the vantage seized of time and place,
6583       And when the wings were opened wide apart,
6584     
6585     He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;
6586       From fell to fell descended downward then
6587       Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.
6588     
6589     When we were come to where the thigh revolves
6590       Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,
6591       The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,
6592     
6593     Turned round his head where he had had his legs,
6594       And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,
6595       So that to Hell I thought we were returning.
6596     
6597     "Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"
6598       The Master said, panting as one fatigued,
6599       "Must we perforce depart from so much evil."
6600     
6601     Then through the opening of a rock he issued,
6602       And down upon the margin seated me;
6603       Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.
6604     
6605     I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see
6606       Lucifer in the same way I had left him;
6607       And I beheld him upward hold his legs.
6608     
6609     And if I then became disquieted,
6610       Let stolid people think who do not see
6611       What the point is beyond which I had passed.
6612     
6613     "Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;
6614       The way is long, and difficult the road,
6615       And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."
6616     
6617     It was not any palace corridor
6618       There where we were, but dungeon natural,
6619       With floor uneven and unease of light.
6620     
6621     "Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,
6622       My Master," said I when I had arisen,
6623       "To draw me from an error speak a little;
6624     
6625     Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed
6626       Thus upside down? and how in such short time
6627       From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"
6628     
6629     And he to me: "Thou still imaginest
6630       Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped
6631       The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.
6632     
6633     That side thou wast, so long as I descended;
6634       When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point
6635       To which things heavy draw from every side,
6636     
6637     And now beneath the hemisphere art come
6638       Opposite that which overhangs the vast
6639       Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death
6640     
6641     The Man who without sin was born and lived.
6642       Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere
6643       Which makes the other face of the Judecca.
6644     
6645     Here it is morn when it is evening there;
6646       And he who with his hair a stairway made us
6647       Still fixed remaineth as he was before.
6648     
6649     Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;
6650       And all the land, that whilom here emerged,
6651       For fear of him made of the sea a veil,
6652     
6653     And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure
6654       To flee from him, what on this side appears
6655       Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."
6656     
6657     A place there is below, from Beelzebub
6658       As far receding as the tomb extends,
6659       Which not by sight is known, but by the sound
6660     
6661     Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth
6662       Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed
6663       With course that winds about and slightly falls.
6664     
6665     The Guide and I into that hidden road
6666       Now entered, to return to the bright world;
6667       And without care of having any rest
6668     
6669     We mounted up, he first and I the second,
6670       Till I beheld through a round aperture
6671       Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;
6672     
6673     Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.

6721     To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
6722     distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
6723     (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
6724     Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
6725     Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

6729     Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
6730     electronic works
6731     
6732     1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
6733     electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
6734     and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
6735     (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
6736     the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
6737     all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
6738     If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
6739     Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
6740     terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
6741     entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
6742     
6743     1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
6744     used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
6745     agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
6746     things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
6747     even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
6748     paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
6749     Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
6750     and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
6751     works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
6752     
6753     1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
6754     or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
6755     Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
6756     collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
6757     individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
6758     located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
6759     copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
6760     works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
6761     are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
6762     Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
6763     freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
6764     this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
6765     the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
6766     keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
6767     Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
6768     
6769     1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
6770     what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
6771     a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
6772     the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
6773     before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
6774     creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
6775     Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
6776     the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
6777     States.
6778     
6779     1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
6780     
6781     1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
6782     access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
6783     whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
6784     phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
6785     Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
6786     copied or distributed:
6787     
6788     This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
6789     almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
6790     re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
6791     with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
6792     
6793     1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
6794     from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
6795     posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
6796     and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
6797     or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
6798     with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
6799     work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
6800     through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
6801     Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
6802     1.E.9.
6803     
6804     1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
6805     with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
6806     must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
6807     terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
6808     to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
6809     permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
6810     
6811     1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
6812     License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
6813     work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
6814     
6815     1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
6816     electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
6817     prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
6818     active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
6819     Gutenberg-tm License.
6820     
6821     1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
6822     compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
6823     word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
6824     distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
6825     "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
6826     posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
6827     you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
6828     copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
6829     request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
6830     form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
6831     License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
6832     
6833     1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
6834     performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
6835     unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
6836     
6837     1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
6838     access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
6839     that
6840     
6841     - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
6842          the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
6843          you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
6844          owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
6845          has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
6846          Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
6847          must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
6848          prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
6849          returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
6850          sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
6851          address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
6852          the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
6853     
6854     - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
6855          you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
6856          does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
6857          License.  You must require such a user to return or
6858          destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
6859          and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
6860          Project Gutenberg-tm works.
6861     
6862     - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
6863          money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
6864          electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
6865          of receipt of the work.
6866     
6867     - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

6871     electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
6872     forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
6873     both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
6874     Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

6876     
6877     1.F.
6878     
6879     1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
6880     effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
6881     public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
6882     collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
6883     works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
6884     "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
6885     corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
6886     property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
6887     computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
6888     your equipment.
6889     
6890     1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
6891     of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
6892     Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
6893     Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
6894     Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
6895     liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
6896     fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
6897     LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
6898     PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
6899     TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
6900     LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
6901     INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
6902     DAMAGE.
6903     
6904     1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
6905     defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
6906     receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
6907     written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
6908     received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
6909     your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
6910     the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
6911     refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
6912     providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
6913     receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
6914     is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
6915     opportunities to fix the problem.
6916     
6917     1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
6918     in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
6919     WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
6920     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
6921     
6922     1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
6923     warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
6924     If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
6925     law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
6926     interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
6927     the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
6928     provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
6929     
6930     1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
6931     trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
6932     providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
6933     with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
6934     promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
6935     harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
6936     that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
6937     or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
6938     work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
6939     Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

6942     Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
6943     
6944     Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
6945     electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
6946     including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
6947     because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
6948     people in all walks of life.
6949     
6950     Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
6951     assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
6952     goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
6953     remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
6954     Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
6955     and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
6956     To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

6987     Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
6988     Literary Archive Foundation
6989     
6990     Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
6991     spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
6992     increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
6993     freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
6994     array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
6995     ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
6996     status with the IRS.
6997     
6998     The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
6999     charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
7000     States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
7001     considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
7002     with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
7003     where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
7004     SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
7005     particular state visit http://pglaf.org
7006     
7007     While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
7008     have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
7009     against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
7010     approach us with offers to donate.
7011     
7012     International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
7013     any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
7014     outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
7015     
7016     Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
7017     methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
7018     ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
7019     donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

7022     Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
7023     works.
7024     
7025     Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
7026     concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
7027     with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
7028     Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
7029     
7030     
7031     Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
7032     editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
7033     unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
7034     keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
7035
